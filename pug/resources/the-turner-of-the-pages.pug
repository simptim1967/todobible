          h2 Introduction
          p
            | One Sunday I took our dogs for a walk. As per usual, I was praying as I was walking when I started to have
            | vivid thoughts and imaginations about God. The thoughts continued later that day and I was compelled to 
            | write them down. So here's what God had me thinking ...
          
          h2 Thoughts inspired by the Holy Spirit
          p
            | What can I say about the turner of the pages? He wrote the whole book before time ever started. 
            | All things in time are known to Him. He turns the pages and His master plan unfolds. He knows the end 
            | already and He tells it from the beginning to those who will listen.
          
          p
            | He exists outside of time. He is limitless in every dimension, dealing with numbers so infinitely large 
            | that they defy imagination, yet He is effortlessly able and cares for each unique individual equally as 
            | much amongst the innumerable. He is truly awesome.
 
          p
            | He is the turner of the pages. Each page births eternal beings, their mortal stories commencing, others 
            | unfolding or ending. Whilst all is known to Him, He Himself desires to be known. He authors Himself an 
            | offering of companionship to those of whom He writes. He is able to converse and participate in the journey. 
            | He weaves the threads of mortal lives.
 
          p
            | To know Him is life. He is the author of it. His words are everlasting, words of truth and comfort, filled 
            | with hope, dispensing joy.  Yet He is ignored, despised, even hated. So often He is left behind by those 
            | in haste, heading to a place they know not where. But He knows. 
 
          p
            | False accusation is levelled at Him by those who do not know Him and those who hate Him. So often He is 
            | blamed but He opens not His mouth. He sees all things. He knows friend from foe, right from wrong, good 
            | from evil. Light and darkness are alike to Him but there is no darkness in Him at all. It was not Him who 
            | came to kill, steal and destroy, nor Him who is named the father of lies.
 
          p
            | He is the defender of the poor, the fatherless, the widow and the stranger. He grasps the wind in His 
            | fists and sends it where He wills. He sits above the circle of the earth looking down on men like ants.
 
          p
            | He is the turner of the pages. History unfolds at His command just as the seas obey His boundaries. He is 
            | kind and gracious. His knowledge is sweet as honey. He paints in dimensions that declare Him: the invisible 
            | attributes of the Creator, made visible for all to see. All things were made by Him, and for Him.
 
          p
            | He is the turner of the pages. No one can resist Him. He is all powerful yet gentle and meek. He is more ready 
            | to forgive than to condemn. His arms are open to receive the lost, celebrating with a heavenly host each child 
            | returning home. He has the first word and the last. He is the living Word that lives forever. No one can change 
            | what He has written.  
 
          p
            | So many threads, unravelling side by side, yet each individual is precious in His sight. He paid the greatest 
            | ransom that each might know Him, the author of their life, the turner of the pages of their destiny, known 
            | intimately to Him before the foundations of the earth were ever set in place.
 
          p
            | If you listen, you can hear the pages turning. The blind have seen Him and the deaf have heard Him. The lost 
            | have found themselves in Him. The whole earth groans for the awakening of His children. Now is not the time to 
            | sleep but to wake up and arise from the dead to be with Him forever.
 
          p
            | Soon the final chapter will be reached, each page now turning faster than the last. The night is far spent. 
            | And He waits, to greet each of those for whom the journey was not in vain. Those who saw the author, and chose 
            | to walk with Him as a friend, collaborating in their lifeâ€™s purpose which He penned.
 
          p
            | His tears are those of compassion. His arms are open to the needy. He is willing to embrace. Look up and see His face. 
 
          p
            | He is the turner of the pages, through the ages He has beckoned and soon all things will be reckoned but He
            | already knows the end. He ever told it from the beginning. 
 
          p
            | Amen.
