          h3 Welcome!
          p
            | Thanks for visiting today to study 
            a(href='../kjv/ephesians_1.html') Ephesians chapter 1
            |.
          
          p
            | I titled this study "Identity Explained" because during this study
            | a number of identities are revealed and explained including that 
            | of our own new identity in Christ.

          p
            | The other identities revealed are the 
            | the three persons of God (the Holy Trinity): God the Father, God the Son and 
            | God the Holy Spirit.
          
          p
            | Once we start to understand our new identity 
            | in Christ we can really begin to grow spiritually.

          p
            | As we study, we'll learn about:

          h3 Before We Start
          p
            | Let's pray:
          
          p
            | Holy Spirit, please help us as we study the Word of God.
            br
            | Give us revelation to understand the true meaning and application of it.
            br
            | Speak to our hearts and make this time profitable to the glory of God.
            br
            | In the name of Jesus we pray.
            br
            | Amen
          
          p
            | Okay. Let's get started.

            |  in Christ Jesus:
          
          p
            | The first word of the first verse reveals Paul as the author of this letter 
            | to the believers at Ephesus whom he refers to as "saints".

          p
            | However, the letter is also addressed "to the faithful in Christ Jesus".
            | Therefore, if you are a believer, this letter is addressed directly to you today
            | as a faithful believer "in Christ Jesus".

              |  Know that Paul&rsquo;s letter to the saints at Ephesus (God&rsquo;s Word)
              | is directly addressed to each of us today as faithful believers in Christ Jesus.
             
          p
            | The phrase "in Christ" (or its equivalent) is used repeatedly throughout the book of Ephesians and 
            | as we study we'll take time to understand exactly what this means in terms of our 
            | identity and how our faith has brought us "into" Christ Jesus.

            | The word "saints" in the Greek is "hagios"&nbsp;
            sup G40
            | meaning "set apart, most holy,
            | sacred, morally blameless".

          p
            | It may surprise you to learn that as believers in Christ we are "saints" and that this description 
            | therefore also applies to us too. We'll see more on this later.

              |  Know that in Christ, we are saints.

          p
            | We also learn from verse 1 that Paul was chosen by "the will of God" to be sent out with authority as an ambassador of Jesus Christ.

          p
            | The word "apostle" in the Greek is "apostolos"&nbsp;
            sup G652
            |  meaning "one sent out with orders".

              span.badge.itemfact F

          p
            a(href='../kjv/acts_9.html') Acts chapter 9
            |  tells us that Paul certainly did not choose this role 
            | for himself but rather Jesus chose it for him.

              | ]

          p
            | So we see that God is at work in the world and in the lives of people. 
            | As we progress our study, we'll see that God has a master plan which He is 
            | executing and that His plan involves people
            | spanning multiple generations on Earth. One day His plan will come to fruition.

            .verse-todo-item
              span.badge.itemcog C
              |  Know that God often involves people to fulfil His plan on the Earth.

          p
            | God may choose even the most unlikely people to fulfil His plan on the Earth,  
            | including those who directly oppose Him.

              |  Know that God may choose even the most unlikely people to fulfil His plan on the Earth, 
              | including those who directly oppose Him.

          p
            | The encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus completely changed Paul's life such that  
            | the former Christian-hating Pharisee known as "Saul of Tarsus" became known as "Paul, 
            | the apostle of Jesus Christ" who was mightily used by God.

          p
            | Let us also likewise fully embrace our new identity and purpose in life as we 
            | discover exactly who we are in Christ.

          p
            | And, with God as Father, come two major benefits for His children: 
            | namely grace and peace!

            .verse-todo-item
              span.badge.itemiic I
              |  Know that grace and peace are ours because God is our Father.

          p
            | The word "grace" in the Greek is "charis"&nbsp;
            sup G5485
            |  meaning "good will, loving kindness, favour".

            | The word "peace" in the Greek is "eirene"&nbsp;
            sup G1515
            | meaning "tranquillity, harmony, 
            | concord, security, safety, prosperity, freedom from fear, quietness of mind".

          p
            | Both wonderful gifts. You may choose to think of grace coming from our loving Father 
            | and peace from the Lord Jesus (
            a(href='../kjv/john_14.html?goto=27') John 14:27
            |), the "Prince of Peace" (
            a(href='../kjv/isaiah_9.html?goto=6') Isaiah 9:6
            |).

              | ]
          
          p
            | However, we are to recognise that grace and peace come from both God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

              span.badge.itemcog C
              |  Know that grace and peace come from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
          
          p
            | This is because not only does Paul want us to understand our own identity in 
            | Christ (and the blessings which are ours as a result)
            | but he also wants us to understand exactly
            | who the Lord Jesus Christ is and that Jesus is equally divine with God the 
            | Father. Hence he uses the full title of "Lord Jesus Christ".

          p
            | Paul calls Jesus "Lord" because that is His title. In fact, Jesus is "King of kings and Lord of lords" (
            a(href='../kjv/1timothy_6.html?goto=15') 1&nbsp;Timothy 6:15
            | ).

          p
            | The name "Jesus" itself means "Jehovah is salvation". 
          
          p
            | In Matthew's gospel we read how Joseph was told in 
            | a dream to use this name by the angel of the Lord
            | who said "thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from 
            | their sins" (
            a(href='../kjv/matthew_1.html?goto=21') Matthew 1:21
            | ). Therefore this name was also to describe His mission.

            | The word "Christ" in the Greek is "Christos"&nbsp;
            sup G5547
            |  meaning "anointed one" 
            | or "chosen one". This is also a title of Jesus 
            | (not a surname as some might think) and is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew 
            | word for "Messiah". 
            
          p
            | Jesus is the Messiah! (Paul even emphasizes this in verse 1
            | through use of "Christ Jesus" instead of "Jesus Christ".)
