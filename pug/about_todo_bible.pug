            | Hello, my name is Tim Simpson from Telford, England. Thanks for visiting
            | ToDoBible.org today.
          p
            | This website documents my on-going journey, as a disciple of Jesus Christ,
            | studying the Holy Bible to learn about what God has done for us, to understand
            | how He wants us to live our
            | lives and how He equips and empowers us to do so as Christians.
          p
            | My quest is to grow in my relationship with Jesus and be taught by Him so that I
            | can become more and more like Him. I want to understand the true meaning of God's Word,
            | learn more about His character and understand the facts and promises as stated in the Holy Bible.
          p
            | Every day I want to draw nearer to God so that He will draw ever nearer to me. I want to
            | learn more about the miraculous power He has bestowed upon me and to see it working
            | in the world as I live to fulfil His plan and purpose for my life.
            | I want to grow spiritually and receive yet more revelation from His Holy Spirit
            | that dwells within me.
          p
            | This website is a work in progress and is continually being updated.
            | I sincerely hope and pray that it blesses and encourages you.
            | Please call back again soon.

          p
            | The King James Bible (also known as The Authorised Version) 
            | is presented as a faithful translation of God's Word
            | with the words of Christ highlighted in 
            span(class='woc') red
            | .
          p
            | My belief is that God's Holy Bible is not just something you read
            | but also very much something you live, breathe and do, by
            | God's grace, for His glory. It is to be read with the heart, not the head and
            | is best done accompanied by the author, the Holy Spirit.

            | the free gift of God by faith in Jesus Christ and cannot be earned.
            | The Bible ToDo List Items listed on this website are therefore not presented
            | as a legalistic list of Christian do's and don'ts.
          p
            | The Bible ToDo List Items echo what the Holy scriptures teach us to do.
            | Some also serve as sincere warnings or to highlight doctrinal truths and promises.
            | All offer friendly encouragement and act as reminders to challenge the believer to
            | incorporate them into daily living whenever opportunity arises.
          p
            | Why not make your bible your ToDo list? 
          p
            | Read it. Believe it. Do it. All for God's glory!
