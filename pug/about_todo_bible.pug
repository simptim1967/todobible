            | Hello, my name is Tim Simpson from Telford, England. Thanks for visiting
            | ToDoBible.org today.
          p
            | This website is all about the practical application of the Holy Bible in daily life. 
            | It also documents my on-going journey, as a disciple of Jesus Christ,
            | studying the Holy Bible to learn about what God has done for us, 
            | how He wants us to live our lives as Christians
            | and how He empowers us to do so.
          p
            | My desire is to grow in my relationship with Jesus so that I
            | can become ever more like Him. I want to understand the true meaning of God's Word,
            | learn more about His character, as well as understand the facts and promises stated in 
            | the Holy Bible.
          p
            | I also want to learn more about the miraculous power He bestows upon believers
            | through the Holy Spirit and to see it working
            | in the world as I live to fulfil His plan and purpose for my life.
          p
            | This website is a work in progress and is continually being updated as I share more
            | of my learning and revelation of God's Word.
            | I sincerely hope and pray that it blesses and encourages you.
            | Please call back again soon.
          h2#kjv King James Bible
          p
            | The King James Bible (also known as The Authorised Version) 
            | is presented as a faithful translation of God's Word
            | with the words of Christ highlighted in 
            span(class='woc') red
            | .
          p
            | My belief is that God's Holy Bible is not just something you read
            | but also very much something you live, breathe and do, by
            | God's grace, for His glory. The Holy Bible is to be read with the heart, not the head and
            | is best read accompanied by the author, the Holy Spirit.
