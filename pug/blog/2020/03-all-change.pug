                |he onset of the COVID-19 Coronoa Virus as a world-wide pandemic has had a massive impact
                | on the world, including loss of life, the collapse of the global economy and changes to our everyday ways of life.

              p
                | Here's how it unfolded (based on the notes I made in my daily journal) and what has changed for us in our house since then.

              p
                | Like many things we hear about, the initial onset of COVID-19 was something that was happening
                | somewhere else, and to someone else. It wasn't happening here, and it certainly wasn't happening to us.

                | I attended the usual 6:00AM Wednesday morning prayer meeting at church. We prayed for a solution to the virus.

                | Even with severe flooding happening in different locations not too far from where we live (and stopping us going to some of the places
                | we sometimes frequent at weekends), life continued very much as before and later that week we attended a concert at the Birmingham NEC along with tens
                | of thousands of others with not so much a mention of the virus.

                | Spoke to my Mum on the phone and was shocked to hear that her and my Dad were fearful of the virus and planning not
                | to go out at all. (I felt my sister had done a little too much scare-mongering.)

                | to the supermarket earlier that week and spent over Â£400 on stock-piling food and was planning to do so again very soon.
                | That seemed crazy.

              p
                | It was then that I realised that the virus was going to be a test of faith. Especially when I heard about
                | the plan to have a test day the following week with everyone in the company working from home.

                | church was unexpectedly closed. Our weekly Sunday service, planned for the 15th March, was cancelled. 

              p
                | This was a disappointing blow (ðŸ˜’) as we were all excited and greatly looking forward to celebrating our new church's first birthday

                | hugging and kissing and shaking hands. Rules around funerals also made it very difficult to support friends in times
                | of great need. We long for the day when we can meet with family and friends once again as before.

              p
                | Throughout all these things, and for however long they continue, we take strength from our faith which 
                | gives us great hope because we know that the Lord will cause all of these things to work for our good. Even when we can't see how!
                | Because we trust His word and because He has shown Himself faithful to keep His promises.
