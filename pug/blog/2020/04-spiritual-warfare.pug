                |othing is as it seems. All around a spiritual war is raging.
                | The war is taking place in the unseen, heavenly realms, between God and the rebel Satan, and spills over into the earthly realm.

              h2 What Does The War Look Like?

              p
                | It's classic good versus evil stuff!

              p
                | Since he was cast out of heaven, the devil has been wreaking havoc in the earth.

              .quoteverse
                p
                  b 8 
                  |  Â Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
                a(href="/kjv/1peter_5.html?goto=8") 1 Peter 5:8

              p
                | Unlike God, who is omnipresent (everywhere at the same time), the devil can only be in one place at any one time
                | but his influence is widespread.
                
              p
                | Many of the spiritual battles and attacks that spill over into the earthly realm often have an "earthly" explanation instead of being
                | recognised as the work or influence of the evil one.

              p
                | For example, crime is often regarded as related to a person's upbringing.
                | Likewise, sickness and disease are linked to germs, genetics or poor diet.
                | Acts of terrorism, due to incorrect ideology.  

              h2 Soldiers Of Christ

              p
                | As Christians, we are not just going through a mere struggle on earth, which is why the bible employs terms like "warfare" and "soldiers of Christ".

              p
                | We ourselves were once part of the rebellion but now we rebel against it, fighting as chosen soldiers of Christ.

              .quoteverse
                p
                  b 3 
                  | Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
                p
                  b 4 
                  | No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of 
                  i
                    | this 
                  | life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
                a(href="/kjv/2timothy_2.html?goto=3-4") 2 Timothy 2:3-4

              h2 Who Is Our Fight With?

              p
                | Our fight is not a war against flesh and blood i.e. is not a fight against people.

              .quoteverse
                p
                  b 12 
                  | For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers
                  | of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high 
                  i
                    | places.
                a(href="/kjv/ephesians_6.html?goto=12") Ephesians 6:12

              p
                | Many Christians mistake their battle to be an on-going fight against sin and the pursuit of holiness but Jesus has already won that battle for us.

              p
                | If you are not currently part of the fight then you have probably been taken captive without realising. 

              p
                | We fight that others might be set free and to protect ourselves from the attacks of the enemy.
                | We also fight to tear down the strongholds of the enemy and take back ground for our God.

              h2 Time To Decide

              p
                | There is no "sitting on the fence" in this war. You are either on one side or the other.
                | Only those who proclaim Jesus as their Lord and saviour can claim to be on God's side. 
                | Dare to stand and join the fight.

              p
                | Whose side are you on?
