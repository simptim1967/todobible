<h1>About TODO:Bible</h1>
<hr>

<p>Thanks for visiting ToDoBible.org today.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>ToDo Bible is a not-for-profit organisation based in the United Kingdom that simply wants to raise 
the world-wide banner that "Jesus Christ is Lord."</p>

<p>Our belief is that God's Holy Bible is not just something you read, it's very much 
something you live, breath and do by God's grace for His glory.</p>

<p>We want Jesus to be at the centre of everything we do.</p>

<p>We seek to glorify God and to help others to do so by knowing Jesus, imitating 
Jesus, serving Jesus and sharing Jesus to make Him known.</p>

<h2>Our Intentions</h2>

<p>We hope that the content presented on this website might be an inspiration to all those 
seeking to follow Jesus for God's glory.</p>

<p>We want to help you make the bible part of your everyday living - in word, thought and deed.</p>

<div class="quoteverse">
<p align="left"><b>8</b>  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>
<b>9</b>  Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
<b>10</b>  For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</p>
<a href="kjv/ephesians_2.html#v8">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>
</div>
 
<p>The ToDo list items and topics are not presented as a legalistic list of Christian "do's and don'ts." 
Neither are they intended to promote justification by works.</p>

<p>The ToDo list seeks to offer readers a chance to learn and be challenged by the scriptures in practical ways 
so that they might increase in the knowledge of God and go on
to demonstrate good works and obedience as a result of their faith.</p>

<p>Often the ToDo items and topics point to spiritual disciplines that may help the reader to 
deepen and strengthen their relationship with God. 
Others serve as faithful warnings, friendly encouragements and
reminders of what the bible teaches us to do.</p>

<p>Why not make your bible your ToDo list? Read it. Believe it. Do it! All for God's glory.</p>

<h2>Our Reliance On Jesus</h2>

<p>We acknowledge first and foremost that without Jesus we can do nothing.
We rely on Him and His grace for all that we do.</p>

<div class="quotebox">
<p>Jesus said:</p>
<woc>&ldquo;without me ye can do nothing&rdquo;</woc>
<a href="kjv/john_15.html#v5">John 15:5</a>
</div>

<p>We must say to all readers from the outset: don't "try" to keep Jesus' commandments 
and instructions in your own intrinsic "power", for you are powerless to carry them out.</p>
 
<p>These are "impossible" standards for fleshly men, but are imminently possible for those 
who learn to surrender to and engage their indwelling omnipotent helper the Holy Spirit.</p> 

<p>The Christian who successfully lives by God's Word is one who is continually 
filled with and controlled by the Spirit (<a href="kjv/ephesians_5.html#v18">Ephesians 5:18</a>) 
and who continually walks by the Spirit (<a href="kjv/galatians_5.html#v16">Galatians 5:16</a>).</p>

<p>The supernatural lifestyle can only be lived out by relinquishing self 
effort and by relying continually on our supernatural source, the Holy Spirit's <i>dunamis</i> (His inherent 
power) to accomplish Jesus' commands and instructions.</p>

<p>Beware of the natural tendency of our fallen flesh to deceive us into thinking 
we can do any of the commands and instructions in our own strength, lest we fall into the subtle 
trap of legalism!</p>

<h2>Tweets Of Encouragement</h2>

<p>We are continually updating the ToDo list items and topics as well as providing tweets
of encouragement.</p>
