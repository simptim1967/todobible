    <b>17</b> And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities <i>were</i> Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.

    <b>23</b> Now therefore ye <i>are</i> cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
