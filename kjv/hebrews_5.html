    <b>2</b> Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.

    <b>4</b> And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as <i>was</i> Aaron.

    <b>8</b> Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
