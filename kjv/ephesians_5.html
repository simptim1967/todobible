    <b>1</b> Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <i>are ye</i> light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> (For the fruit of the Spirit <i>is</i> in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove <i>them</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord <i>is</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <i>let</i> the wives <i>be</i> to their own husbands in every thing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife <i>see</i> that she reverence <i>her</i> husband.
