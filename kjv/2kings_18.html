    <b>1</b> Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, <i>that</i> Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also <i>was</i> Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And he did <i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, according to all that David his father did.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> He trusted in the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor <i>any</i> that were before him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> For he clave to the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, <i>and</i> departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> commanded Moses.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was with him; <i>and</i> he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> He smote the Philistines, <i>even</i> unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which <i>was</i> the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, <i>that</i> Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And at the end of three years they took it: <i>even</i> in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that <i>is</i> the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor <i>by</i> the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Because they obeyed not the voice of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> their God, but transgressed his covenant, <i>and</i> all that Moses the servant of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> commanded, and would not hear <i>them</i>, nor do <i>them</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Hezekiah gave <i>him</i> all the silver that was found in the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and in the treasures of the king's house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> At that time did Hezekiah cut off <i>the gold from</i> the doors of the temple of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and <i>from</i> the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which <i>is</i> in the highway of the fuller's field.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which <i>was</i> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence <i>is</i> this wherein thou trustest?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Thou sayest, (but <i>they are but</i> vain words,) <i>I have</i> counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, <i>even</i> upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so <i>is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> But if ye say unto me, We trust in the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> our God: <i>is</i> not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Am I now come up without the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> against this place to destroy it? The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand <i>it</i>: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that <i>are</i> on the wall.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? <i>hath he</i> not <i>sent me</i> to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, saying, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make <i>an agreement</i> with me by a present, and come out to me, and <i>then</i> eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> will deliver us.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Where <i>are</i> the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> Who <i>are</i> they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which <i>was</i> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with <i>their</i> clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.
