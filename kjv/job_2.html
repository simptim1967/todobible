<div class="verse" id="v2">

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And Satan answered the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.

    <b>7</b> So went Satan forth from the presence of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.

    <b>8</b> And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.

    <b>13</b> So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that <i>his</i> grief was very great.
