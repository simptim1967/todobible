    <b>2</b> And after six days Jesus taketh <i>with him</i> Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

    <b>6</b> For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.

    <b>7</b> And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And he answered and told them, <span style="color:red;">Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> <span style="color:red;">But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.</span>

    <b>14</b> And when he came to <i>his</i> disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.

    <b>18</b> And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> He answereth him, and saith, <span style="color:red;">O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.</span>

    <b>20</b> And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.

<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And he asked his father, <span style="color:red;">How long is it ago since this came unto him?</span> And he said, Of a child.

<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.

    <b>23</b> Jesus said unto him, <span style="color:red;">If thou canst believe, all things <i>are</i> possible to him that believeth.</span>

    <b>24</b> And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, <span style="color:red;"><i>Thou</i> dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And <i>the spirit</i> cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And he said unto them, <span style="color:red;">This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know <i>it</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, <span style="color:red;">The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, <span style="color:red;">What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who <i>should be</i> the greatest.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, <span style="color:red;">If any man desire to be first, <i>the same</i> shall be last of all, and servant of all.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,

<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> <span style="color:red;">Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> But Jesus said, <span style="color:red;">Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">

    <b>42</b> <span style="color:red;">And whosoever shall offend one of <i>these</i> little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> <span style="color:red;">And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</span>
