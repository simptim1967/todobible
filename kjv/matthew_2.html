    <b>1</b> Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,

<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> When Herod the king had heard <i>these things</i>, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And thou Bethlehem, <i>in</i> the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.

<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found <i>him</i>, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.

<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

    <b>13</b> And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.

    <b>14</b> When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:

    <b>17</b> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
