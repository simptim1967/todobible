    <b>4</b> And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Therefore the anger of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And when the children of Israel cried unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, <i>even</i> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the Spirit of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.

<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> But when the children of Israel cried unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon <i>was</i> a very fat man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> But he himself turned again from the quarries that <i>were</i> by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of <i>his</i> seat.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour <i>were</i> locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened <i>them</i>: and, behold, their lord <i>was</i> fallen down dead on the earth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.
