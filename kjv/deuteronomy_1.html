    <b>27</b> And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people <i>is</i> greater and taller than we; the cities <i>are</i> great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.

<div class="verse" id="v32">

<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,

<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> Also the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.
