    <b>1</b> Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we <i>are</i> thy bone and thy flesh.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: and they anointed David king over Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> David <i>was</i> thirty years old when he began to reign, <i>and</i> he reigned forty years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same <i>is</i> the city of David.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, <i>that are</i> hated of David's soul, <i>he shall be chief and captain</i>. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And David went on, and grew great, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of hosts <i>was</i> with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And David perceived that the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And David took <i>him</i> more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And these <i>be</i> the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

    <b>15</b> Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

    <b>16</b> And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard <i>of it</i>, and went down to the hold.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And David enquired of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And when David enquired of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, he said, Thou shalt not go up; <i>but</i> fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And David did so, as the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.
