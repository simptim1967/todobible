    <b>1</b> <woc>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> <woc>And five of them were wise, and five <i>were</i> foolish.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> <woc>They that <i>were</i> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> <woc>But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> <woc>While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> <woc>And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> <woc>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</woc>
</div>

    <b>8</b> <woc>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> <woc>But the wise answered, saying, <i>Not so</i>; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> <woc>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> <woc>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <woc>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</woc>

    <b>13</b> <woc>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> <woc>For <i>the kingdom of heaven is</i> as a man travelling into a far country, <i>who</i> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> <woc>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> <woc>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <i>them</i> other five talents.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> <woc>And likewise he that <i>had received</i> two, he also gained other two.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <woc>After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> <woc>And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> <woc>His lord said unto him, Well done, <i>thou</i> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <woc>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <woc>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <woc>Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <woc>And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <i>there</i> thou hast <i>that is</i> thine.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>His lord answered and said unto him, <i>Thou</i> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <woc>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <i>then</i> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <woc>Take therefore the talent from him, and give <i>it</i> unto him which hath ten talents.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <woc>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <woc>And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> <woc>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <woc>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <i>his</i> sheep from the goats:</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> <woc>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> <woc>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</woc>

    <b>35</b> <woc>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</woc>
