    <b>1</b> And he spake a parable unto them <i>to this end</i>, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Saying, <woc>There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> <woc>And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> <woc>And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> <woc>Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And the Lord said, <woc>Hear what the unjust judge saith.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> <woc>And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <woc>I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> <woc>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> <woc>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men <i>are</i>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <woc>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> <woc>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as <i>his</i> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> <woc>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified <i>rather</i> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when <i>his</i> disciples saw <i>it</i>, they rebuked them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> But Jesus called them <i>unto him</i>, and said, <woc>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> <woc>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And Jesus said unto him, <woc>Why callest thou me good? none <i>is</i> good, save one, <i>that is</i>, God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> <woc>Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, <woc>Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, <woc>How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <woc>For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And they that heard <i>it</i> said, Who then can be saved?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And he said, <woc>The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <woc>Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Then he took <i>unto him</i> the twelve, and said unto them, <woc>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <woc>For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> <woc>And they shall scourge <i>him</i>, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And he cried, saying, Jesus, <i>thou</i> Son of David, have mercy on me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, <i>Thou</i> Son of David, have mercy on me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> Saying, <woc>What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?</woc> And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And Jesus said unto him, <woc>Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw <i>it</i>, gave praise unto God.
