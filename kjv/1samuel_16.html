    <b>1</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear <i>it</i>, he will kill me. And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me <i>him</i> whom I name unto thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And Samuel did that which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>'s anointed <i>is</i> before him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> But the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for <i>the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> seeth</i> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> looketh on the heart.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> chosen this.

<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> chosen this.

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath not chosen these.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all <i>thy</i> children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he <i>was</i> ruddy, <i>and</i> withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said, Arise, anoint him: for this <i>is</i> he.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> But the Spirit of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> troubled him.

<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.

<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Let our lord now command thy servants, <i>which are</i> before thee, to seek out a man, <i>who is</i> a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring <i>him</i> to me.

<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, <i>that is</i> cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> <i>is</i> with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which <i>is</i> with the sheep.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And Jesse took an ass <i>laden</i> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent <i>them</i> by David his son unto Saul.

<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And it came to pass, when the <i>evil</i> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
