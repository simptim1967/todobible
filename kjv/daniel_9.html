    <b>2</b> In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">

    <b>4</b> And I prayed unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.

    <b>11</b> Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that <i>is</i> written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.

<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.

    <b>13</b> As <i>it is</i> written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.

    <b>22</b> And he informed <i>me</i>, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.

    <b>24</b> Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Know therefore and understand, <i>that</i> from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince <i>shall be</i> seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof <i>shall be</i> with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make <i>it</i> desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
