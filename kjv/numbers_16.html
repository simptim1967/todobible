</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:

<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, <i>Ye take</i> too much upon you, seeing all the congregation <i>are</i> holy, every one of them, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> <i>is</i> among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>?

<div class="verse" id="v8">

<div class="verse" id="v9">

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And he hath brought thee near <i>to him</i>, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:

    <b>14</b> Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.

    <b>15</b> And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.

    <b>17</b> And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each <i>of you</i> his censer.

<div class="verse" id="v18">

    <b>19</b> And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> appeared unto all the congregation.

<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

    <b>21</b> Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> spake unto Moses, saying,

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> hath sent me to do all these works; for <i>I have</i> not <i>done them</i> of mine own mind.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; <i>then</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> hath not sent me.

<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> But if the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that <i>appertain</i> unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that <i>was</i> under them:

<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that <i>appertained</i> unto Korah, and all <i>their</i> goods.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> They, and all that <i>appertained</i> to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.

<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And all Israel that <i>were</i> round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up <i>also</i>.

<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And there came out a fire from the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> spake unto Moses, saying,

<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.

<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates <i>for</i> a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad <i>plates for</i> a covering of the altar:

<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> <i>To be</i> a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which <i>is</i> not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> said to him by the hand of Moses.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> appeared.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.

<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>; the plague is begun.

<div class="verse" id="v47">
