    <b>1</b> Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and <i>that</i> there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in <i>some one of</i> the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I <i>am</i> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Wherein <i>was</i> written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith <i>it, that</i> thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, <i>There is</i> a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, <i>O God</i>, strengthen my hands.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who <i>was</i> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who <i>is there</i>, that, <i>being</i> as I <i>am</i>, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Therefore <i>was</i> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and <i>that</i> they might have <i>matter</i> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <i>day</i> of <i>the month</i> Elul, in fifty and two days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard <i>thereof</i>, and all the heathen that <i>were</i> about us saw <i>these things</i>, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <i>the letters</i> of Tobiah came unto them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> For <i>there were</i> many in Judah sworn unto him, because he <i>was</i> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. <i>And</i> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
