    <b>1</b> And he began to speak unto them by parables. <woc>A <i>certain</i> man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about <i>it</i>, and digged <i>a place for</i> the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> <woc>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> <woc>And they caught <i>him</i>, and beat him, and sent <i>him</i> away empty.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> <woc>And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded <i>him</i> in the head, and sent <i>him</i> away shamefully handled.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> <woc>And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> <woc>Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> <woc>But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <woc>And they took him, and killed <i>him</i>, and cast <i>him</i> out of the vineyard.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> <woc>What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> <woc>And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> <woc>This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in <i>his</i> words.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, <woc>Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see <i>it</i>.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And they brought <i>it</i>. And he saith unto them, <woc>Whose <i>is</i> this image and superscription?</woc> And they said unto him, Caesar's.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And Jesus answering said unto them, <woc>Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.</woc> And they marvelled at him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave <i>his</i> wife <i>behind him</i>, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And Jesus answering said unto them, <woc>Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <woc>For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I <i>am</i> the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <woc>He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And Jesus answered him, <woc>The first of all the commandments <i>is</i>, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <woc>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this <i>is</i> the first commandment.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> <woc>And the second <i>is</i> like, <i>namely</i> this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love <i>his</i> neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, <woc>Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</woc> And no man after that durst ask him <i>any question</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, <woc>How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> <woc>For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> <woc>David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he <i>then</i> his son?</woc> And the common people heard him gladly.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And he said unto them in his doctrine, <woc>Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and <i>love</i> salutations in the marketplaces,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> <woc>And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> <woc>Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And he called <i>unto him</i> his disciples, and saith unto them, <woc>Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> <woc>For all <i>they</i> did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, <i>even</i> all her living.</woc>
