    <b>1</b> Now of the things which we have spoken <i>this is</i> the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore <i>it is</i> of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, <i>that</i> thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> For if that first <i>covenant</i> had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For this <i>is</i> the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> In that he saith, A new <i>covenant</i>, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old <i>is</i> ready to vanish away.
