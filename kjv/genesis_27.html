<div class="verse" id="v21">

    <b>23</b> And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.

<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son <i>is</i> as the smell of a field which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath blessed:

<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

    <b>32</b> And Isaac his father said unto him, Who <i>art</i> thou? And he said, I <i>am</i> thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, <i>even</i> me also, O my father.

<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.

<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, <i>even</i> me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.

<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;

<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, <i>purposing</i> to kill thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;

<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget <i>that</i> which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these <i>which are</i> of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
