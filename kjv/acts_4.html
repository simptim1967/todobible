    <b>1</b> And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And they laid hands on them, and put <i>them</i> in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <i>even</i> by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them <i>is</i> manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny <i>it</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <i>men</i> glorified God for that which was done.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou <i>art</i> God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any <i>of them</i> that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And laid <i>them</i> down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, <i>and</i> of the country of Cyprus,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> Having land, sold <i>it</i>, and brought the money, and laid <i>it</i> at the apostles' feet.
