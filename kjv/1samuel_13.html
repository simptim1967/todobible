    <b>1</b> Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Saul chose him three thousand <i>men</i> of Israel; <i>whereof</i> two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that <i>was</i> in Geba, and the Philistines heard <i>of it</i>. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And all Israel heard say <i>that</i> Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and <i>that</i> Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which <i>is</i> on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And <i>some of</i> the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he <i>was</i> yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel <i>had appointed</i>: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and <i>that</i> thou camest not within the days appointed, and <i>that</i> the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath commanded him <i>to be</i> captain over his people, because thou hast not kept <i>that</i> which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> commanded thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people <i>that were</i> present with him, about six hundred men.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people <i>that were</i> present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way <i>that leadeth to</i> Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And another company turned the way <i>to</i> Beth-horon: and another company turned <i>to</i> the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make <i>them</i> swords or spears:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that <i>were</i> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
