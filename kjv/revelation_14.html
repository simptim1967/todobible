    <b>2</b> And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:

    <b>3</b> And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred <i>and</i> forty <i>and</i> four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.

    <b>4</b> These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, <i>being</i> the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.

    <b>10</b> The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
