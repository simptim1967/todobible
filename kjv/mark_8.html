    <b>1</b> In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples <i>unto him</i>, and saith unto them,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> <woc>I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> <woc>And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these <i>men</i> with bread here in the wilderness?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And he asked them, <woc>How many loaves have ye?</woc> And they said, Seven.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before <i>them</i>; and they did set <i>them</i> before the people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before <i>them</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <i>meat</i> that was left seven baskets.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, <woc>Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Now <i>the disciples</i> had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And he charged them, saying, <woc>Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and <i>of</i> the leaven of Herod.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <i>It is</i> because we have no bread.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And when Jesus knew <i>it</i>, he saith unto them, <woc>Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <woc>When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</woc> They say unto him, Twelve.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> <woc>And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</woc> And they said, Seven.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And he said unto them, <woc>How is it that ye do not understand?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> After that he put <i>his</i> hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And he sent him away to his house, saying, <woc>Neither go into the town, nor tell <i>it</i> to any in the town.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, <woc>Whom do men say that I am?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And they answered, John the Baptist: but some <i>say</i>, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And he saith unto them, <woc>But whom say ye that I am?</woc> And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and <i>of</i> the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, <woc>Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And when he had called the people <i>unto him</i> with his disciples also, he said unto them, <woc>Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> <woc>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> <woc>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> <woc>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> <woc>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</woc>
