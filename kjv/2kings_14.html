    <b>1</b> In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name <i>was</i> Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And he did <i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that <i>was</i> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that <i>was</i> in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that <i>was</i> in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory <i>of this</i>, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to <i>thy</i> hurt, that thou shouldest fall, <i>even</i> thou, and Judah with thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and in the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which <i>was</i> sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, <i>and reigned</i> forty and one years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And he did <i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which <i>was</i> of Gath-hepher.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> For the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> saw the affliction of Israel, <i>that it was</i> very bitter: for <i>there was</i> not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, <i>which belonged</i> to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, <i>even</i> with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.
