    <b>1</b> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> The same was in the beginning with God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> There was a man sent from God, whose name <i>was</i> John.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all <i>men</i> through him might believe.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> He was not that Light, but <i>was sent</i> to bear witness of that Light.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> <i>That</i> was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, <i>even</i> to them that believe on his name:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> For the law was given by Moses, <i>but</i> grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared <i>him</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> He said, I <i>am</i> the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, <span style="color:red;">What seek ye?</span> They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> He saith unto them, <span style="color:red;">Come and see.</span> They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> One of the two which heard John <i>speak</i>, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, <span style="color:red;">Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,</span> which is by interpretation, A stone.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, <span style="color:red;">Follow me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, <span style="color:red;">Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> Jesus answered and said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> And he saith unto him, <span style="color:red;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span>
