    <b>1</b> I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, <i>of</i> the tribe of Benjamin.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to <i>the image of</i> Baal.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And if by grace, then <i>is it</i> no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if <i>it be</i> of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but <i>rather</i> through their fall salvation <i>is come</i> unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Now if the fall of them <i>be</i> the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> If by any means I may provoke to emulation <i>them which are</i> my flesh, and might save some of them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> For if the casting away of them <i>be</i> the reconciling of the world, what <i>shall</i> the receiving <i>of them be</i>, but life from the dead?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> For if the firstfruit <i>be</i> holy, the lump <i>is</i> also <i>holy</i>: and if the root <i>be</i> holy, so <i>are</i> the branches.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> For if God spared not the natural branches, <i>take heed</i> lest he also spare not thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in <i>his</i> goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural <i>branches</i>, be graffed into their own olive tree?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> For this <i>is</i> my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> As concerning the gospel, <i>they are</i> enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, <i>they are</i> beloved for the fathers' sakes.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> For the gifts and calling of God <i>are</i> without repentance.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable <i>are</i> his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> For of him, and through him, and to him, <i>are</i> all things: to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever. Amen.
