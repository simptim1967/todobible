    <b>1</b> In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, <woc>Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> <woc>For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.</woc>
</div>

<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And he spake a parable unto them, saying, <woc>The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">

    <b>23</b> <woc>The life is more than meat, and the body <i>is more</i> than raiment.</woc>

    <b>31</b> <woc>But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.</woc>
