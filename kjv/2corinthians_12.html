    <b>1</b> It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but <i>now</i> I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me <i>to be</i>, or <i>that</i> he heareth of me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And he said unto me, <woc>My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</woc> Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except <i>it be</i> that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> I desired Titus, and with <i>him</i> I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? <i>walked we</i> not in the same steps?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but <i>we do</i> all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and <i>that</i> I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest <i>there be</i> debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> <i>And</i> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and <i>that</i> I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
