<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> <i>Saying</i>, <span style="color:red;">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</span>

<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> But Jesus called them <i>to him</i>, and saith unto them, <span style="color:red;">Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</span>

<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> <span style="color:red;">But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</span>

<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> <span style="color:red;">And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</span>
