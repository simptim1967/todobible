<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> <i>Saying</i>, <woc>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</woc>

    <b>35</b> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.

    <b>36</b> And he said unto them, <woc>What would ye that I should do for you?</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> But Jesus said unto them, <woc>Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, <woc>Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> <woc>But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but <i>it shall be given to them</i> for whom it is prepared.</woc>

    <b>41</b> And when the ten heard <i>it</i>, they began to be much displeased with James and John.

<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> <woc>But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</woc>

    <b>46</b> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.

    <b>47</b> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, <i>thou</i> Son of David, have mercy on me.
