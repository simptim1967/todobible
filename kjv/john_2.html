    <b>9</b> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,

    <b>10</b> And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: <i>but</i> thou hast kept the good wine until now.

    <b>11</b> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.

    <b>12</b> After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.

    <b>13</b> And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,

<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;

    <b>16</b> And said unto them that sold doves, <woc>Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</woc>
