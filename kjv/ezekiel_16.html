<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time <i>was</i> the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>God</span>, and thou becamest mine.

    <b>26</b> Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.
