<div class="verse" id="v4">

<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.

<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, <i>being</i> an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, <i>to wit</i>, of a Jew his brother.

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let <i>them</i> go.

    <b>13</b> Thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,

    <b>14</b> At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.

    <b>15</b> And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:

    <b>16</b> But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.
