    <b>1</b> Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which <i>was</i> our brother Elimelech's:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy <i>it</i> before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem <i>it</i>, redeem <i>it</i>: but if thou wilt not redeem <i>it, then</i> tell me, that I may know: for <i>there is</i> none to redeem <i>it</i> beside thee; and I <i>am</i> after thee. And he said, I will redeem <i>it</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy <i>it</i> also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem <i>it</i> for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem <i>it</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Now this <i>was the manner</i> in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave <i>it</i> to his neighbour: and this <i>was</i> a testimony in Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy <i>it</i> for thee. So he drew off his shoe.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And Boaz said unto the elders, and <i>unto</i> all the people, Ye <i>are</i> witnesses this day, that I have bought all that <i>was</i> Elimelech's, and all that <i>was</i> Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye <i>are</i> witnesses this day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And all the people that <i>were</i> in the gate, and the elders, said, <i>We are</i> witnesses. The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Beth-lehem:
</div>

    <b>12</b> And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> shall give thee of this young woman.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> gave her conception, and she bare a son.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And he shall be unto thee a restorer of <i>thy</i> life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.

<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.

<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he <i>is</i> the father of Jesse, the father of David.
