    <b>1</b> And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David <i>is</i> in the wilderness of En-gedi.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where <i>was</i> a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And he said unto his men, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>'s anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he <i>is</i> the anointed of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on <i>his</i> way.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and <i>some</i> bade <i>me</i> kill thee: but <i>mine eye</i> spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he <i>is</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>'s anointed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that <i>there is</i> neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> judge between me and thee, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

    <b>14</b> After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, <i>Is</i> this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And he said to David, Thou <i>art</i> more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Swear now therefore unto me by the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
