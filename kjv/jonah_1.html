<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> But the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.

<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that <i>were</i> in the ship into the sea, to lighten <i>it</i> of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.

<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil <i>is</i> upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

    <b>8</b> Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil <i>is</i> upon us; What <i>is</i> thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what <i>is</i> thy country? and of what people <i>art</i> thou?

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, because he had told them.
