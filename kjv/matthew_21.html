<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed <i>is</i> he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And said unto them, <span style="color:red;">It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span>

    <b>14</b> And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.

    <b>24</b> And Jesus answered and said unto them, <span style="color:red;">I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <span style="color:red;">The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?</span> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.

<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, <span style="color:red;">Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <span style="color:red;">But what think ye? A <i>certain</i> man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <span style="color:red;">He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <span style="color:red;">And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I <i>go</i>, sir: and went not.</span>

    <b>31</b> <span style="color:red;">Whether of them twain did the will of <i>his</i> father?</span> They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, <span style="color:red;">Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <span style="color:red;">For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen <i>it</i>, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> <span style="color:red;">Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> <span style="color:red;">And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> <span style="color:red;">And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> <span style="color:red;">Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> <span style="color:red;">But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> <span style="color:red;">But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> <span style="color:red;">And they caught him, and cast <i>him</i> out of the vineyard, and slew <i>him</i>.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> <span style="color:red;">When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out <i>his</i> vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> Jesus saith unto them, <span style="color:red;">Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> <span style="color:red;">Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> <span style="color:red;">And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
