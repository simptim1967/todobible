    <b>1</b> After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is <i>the sea</i> of Tiberias.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> When Jesus then lifted up <i>his</i> eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, <span style="color:red;">Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And Jesus said, <span style="color:red;">Make the men sit down.</span> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, <span style="color:red;">Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Therefore they gathered <i>them</i> together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And when even was <i>now</i> come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> But he saith unto them, <span style="color:red;">It is I; be not afraid.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but <i>that</i> his disciples were gone away alone;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> Jesus answered them and said, <span style="color:red;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <span style="color:red;">Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Jesus answered and said unto them, <span style="color:red;">This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> Then Jesus said unto them, <span style="color:red;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> <span style="color:red;">For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And Jesus said unto them, <span style="color:red;">I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> <span style="color:red;">But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> <span style="color:red;">All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> <span style="color:red;">For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> <span style="color:red;">And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> <span style="color:red;">And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, <span style="color:red;">I am the bread which came down from heaven.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, <span style="color:red;">I came down from heaven?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, <span style="color:red;">Murmur not among yourselves.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> <span style="color:red;">No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> <span style="color:red;">It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> <span style="color:red;">Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> <span style="color:red;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> <span style="color:red;">I am that bread of life.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> <span style="color:red;">Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> <span style="color:red;">This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> <span style="color:red;">I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us <i>his</i> flesh to eat?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> Then Jesus said unto them, <span style="color:red;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v54">
    <b>54</b> <span style="color:red;">Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v55">
    <b>55</b> <span style="color:red;">For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v56">
    <b>56</b> <span style="color:red;">He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v57">
    <b>57</b> <span style="color:red;">As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v58">
    <b>58</b> <span style="color:red;">This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v59">
    <b>59</b> These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v60">
    <b>60</b> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard <i>this</i>, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v61">
    <b>61</b> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, <span style="color:red;">Doth this offend you?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v62">
    <b>62</b> <span style="color:red;"><i>What</i> and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v63">
    <b>63</b> <span style="color:red;">It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, <i>they</i> are spirit, and <i>they</i> are life.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v64">
    <b>64</b> <span style="color:red;">But there are some of you that believe not.</span> For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v65">
    <b>65</b> And he said, <span style="color:red;">Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v66">
    <b>66</b> From that <i>time</i> many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.

<div class="verse" id="v68">
    <b>68</b> Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
