    <b>1</b> Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort <i>you</i> by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, <i>so</i> ye would abound more and more.

<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> For this is the will of God, <i>even</i> your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:

    <b>6</b> That no <i>man</i> go beyond and defraud his brother in <i>any</i> matter: because that the Lord <i>is</i> the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.

    <b>10</b> And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;

    <b>11</b> And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
