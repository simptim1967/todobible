<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:

    <b>4</b> Who are Israelites; to whom <i>pertaineth</i> the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service <i>of God</i>, and the promises;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Whose <i>are</i> the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ <i>came</i>, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they <i>are</i> not all Israel, which are of Israel:

    <b>7</b> Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, <i>are they</i> all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.

<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these <i>are</i> not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.

    <b>9</b> For this <i>is</i> the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.

<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> What shall we say then? <i>Is there</i> unrighteousness with God? God forbid.

<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> So then <i>it is</i> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.

<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <i>What</i> if God, willing to shew <i>his</i> wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

    <b>24</b> Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?

<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:

<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> For he will finish the work, and cut <i>it</i> short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.

<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> Wherefore? Because <i>they sought it</i> not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
