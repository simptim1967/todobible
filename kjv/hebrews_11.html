    <b>1</b> Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> For by it the elders obtained a good report.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to please <i>him</i>: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <i>that</i> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as <i>in</i> a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker <i>is</i> God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, <i>so many</i> as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of <i>them</i>, and embraced <i>them</i>, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And truly, if they had been mindful of that <i>country</i> from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> But now they desire a better <i>country</i>, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten <i>son</i>,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Accounting that God <i>was</i> able to raise <i>him</i> up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, <i>leaning</i> upon the top of his staff.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw <i>he was</i> a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry <i>land</i>: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and <i>of</i> Barak, and <i>of</i> Samson, and <i>of</i> Jephthae; <i>of</i> David also, and Samuel, and <i>of</i> the prophets:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And others had trial of <i>cruel</i> mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and <i>in</i> mountains, and <i>in</i> dens and caves of the earth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
