    <b>2</b> If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay <i>it</i> to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay <i>it</i> to heart.

<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, <i>even</i> the dung of your solemn feasts; and <i>one</i> shall take you away with it.

    <b>4</b> And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> of hosts.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him <i>for</i> the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.

    <b>6</b> The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.
</div>

    <b>7</b> For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he <i>is</i> the messenger of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> of hosts.

<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> of hosts.

<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.
