    <b>1</b> And Elijah the Tishbite, <i>who was</i> of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, <i>As</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> came unto him, saying,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that <i>is</i> before Jordan.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And it shall be, <i>that</i> thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> So he went and did according unto the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that <i>is</i> before Jordan.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> came unto him, saying,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which <i>belongeth</i> to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman <i>was</i> there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And as she was going to fetch <i>it</i>, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And she said, <i>As</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I <i>am</i> gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go <i>and</i> do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring <i>it</i> unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> For thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day <i>that</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sendeth rain upon the earth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat <i>many</i> days.

<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And it came to pass after these things, <i>that</i> the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And he cried unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and said, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and said, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.

    <b>24</b> And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou <i>art</i> a man of God, <i>and</i> that the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> in thy mouth <i>is</i> truth.
