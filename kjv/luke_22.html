    <b>1</b> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And he sent Peter and John, saying, <woc>Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> <woc>And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <woc>And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And he said unto them, <woc>With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> <woc>For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, <woc>Take this, and divide <i>it</i> among yourselves:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake <i>it</i>, and gave unto them, saying, <woc>This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, <woc>This cup <i>is</i> the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> <woc>But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me <i>is</i> with me on the table.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <woc>And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And he said unto them, <woc>The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>But ye <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <woc>For whether <i>is</i> greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? <i>is</i> not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <woc>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <woc>And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <woc>That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And the Lord said, <woc>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired <i>to have</i> you, that he may sift <i>you</i> as wheat:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <woc>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And he said, <woc>I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And he said unto them, <woc>When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing?</woc> And they said, Nothing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> Then said he unto them, <woc>But now, he that hath a purse, let him take <i>it</i>, and likewise <i>his</i> scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> <woc>For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And they said, Lord, behold, here <i>are</i> two swords. And he said unto them, <woc>It is enough.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, <woc>Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> Saying, <woc>Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And said unto them, <woc>Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> But Jesus said unto him, <woc>Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> And Jesus answered and said, <woc>Suffer ye thus far.</woc> And he touched his ear, and healed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, <woc>Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> <woc>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v54">
    <b>54</b> Then took they him, and led <i>him</i>, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v55">
    <b>55</b> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v56">
    <b>56</b> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v57">
    <b>57</b> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v58">
    <b>58</b> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v59">
    <b>59</b> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this <i>fellow</i> also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v60">
    <b>60</b> And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v61">
    <b>61</b> And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, <woc>Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v62">
    <b>62</b> And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v63">
    <b>63</b> And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote <i>him</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v64">
    <b>64</b> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v65">
    <b>65</b> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v66">
    <b>66</b> And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v67">
    <b>67</b> Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, <woc>If I tell you, ye will not believe:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v68">
    <b>68</b> <woc>And if I also ask <i>you</i>, ye will not answer me, nor let <i>me</i> go.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v69">
    <b>69</b> <woc>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v70">
    <b>70</b> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, <woc>Ye say that I am.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v71">
    <b>71</b> And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
