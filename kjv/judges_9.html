</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">

    <b>4</b> And they gave him threescore and ten <i>pieces</i> of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.

<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, <i>being</i> threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that <i>was</i> in Shechem.

<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And when they told <i>it</i> to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.

<div class="verse" id="v8">

<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> That the cruelty <i>done</i> to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode <i>the grapes</i>, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who <i>is</i> Abimelech, and who <i>is</i> Shechem, that we should serve him? <i>is</i> not <i>he</i> the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that <i>is</i> with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And it shall be, <i>that</i> in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, <i>when</i> he and the people that <i>is</i> with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that <i>were</i> with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that <i>were</i> with him, from lying in wait.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as <i>if they were</i> men.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> Then said Zebul unto him, Where <i>is</i> now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who <i>is</i> Abimelech, that we should serve him? <i>is</i> not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown <i>and</i> wounded, <i>even</i> unto the entering of the gate.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people <i>were</i> come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And Abimelech, and the company that <i>was</i> with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two <i>other</i> companies ran upon all <i>the people</i> that <i>were</i> in the fields, and slew them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that <i>was</i> therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard <i>that</i>, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that <i>were</i> with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid <i>it</i> on his shoulder, and said unto the people that <i>were</i> with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, <i>and</i> do as I <i>have done</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put <i>them</i> to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut <i>it</i> to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v54">
    <b>54</b> Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v55">
    <b>55</b> And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v56">
    <b>56</b> Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v57">
    <b>57</b> And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
