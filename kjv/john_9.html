    <b>1</b> And as <i>Jesus</i> passed by, he saw a man which was blind from <i>his</i> birth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Jesus answered, <span style="color:red;">Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> <span style="color:red;">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> <span style="color:red;">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,</span> (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Some said, This is he: others <i>said</i>, He is like him: <i>but</i> he said, I am <i>he</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, <span style="color:red;">Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash:</span> and I went and washed, and I received sight.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> These <i>words</i> spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner <i>or no</i>, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear <i>it</i> again? will ye also be his disciples?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> We know that God spake unto Moses: <i>as for</i> this <i>fellow</i>, we know not from whence he is.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <i>yet</i> he hath opened mine eyes.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And Jesus said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And Jesus said, <span style="color:red;">For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And <i>some</i> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> Jesus said unto them, <span style="color:red;">If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</span>
