    <b>1</b> And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and <i>with</i> a certain orator <i>named</i> Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse <i>him</i>, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> We accept <i>it</i> always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> For we have found this man <i>a</i> pestilent <i>fellow</i>, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> But the chief captain Lysias came <i>upon us</i>, and with great violence took <i>him</i> away out of our hands,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and <i>toward</i> men.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Or else let these same <i>here</i> say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of <i>that</i> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let <i>him</i> have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
