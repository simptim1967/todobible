    <b>1</b> In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first <i>day</i> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <i>men</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <woc>All hail.</woc> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Then said Jesus unto them, <woc>Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <i>away</i> while we slept.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

    <b>17</b> And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, <woc>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <woc>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</woc>
