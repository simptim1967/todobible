    <b>1</b> And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing <i>their</i> nets.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, <woc>Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And they beckoned unto <i>their</i> partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> When Simon Peter saw <i>it</i>, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And so <i>was</i> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, <woc>Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on <i>his</i> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And he put forth <i>his</i> hand, and touched him, saying, <woc>I will: be thou clean.</woc> And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And he charged him to tell no man: <woc>but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was <i>present</i> to heal them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought <i>means</i> to bring him in, and to lay <i>him</i> before him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And when they could not find by what <i>way</i> they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with <i>his</i> couch into the midst before Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, <woc>Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, <woc>What reason ye in your hearts?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <woc>Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <woc>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,</woc> (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) <woc>I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, <woc>Follow me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And Jesus answering said unto them, <woc>They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <woc>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise <i>the disciples</i> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> <woc>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And he spake also a parable unto them; <woc>No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was <i>taken</i> out of the new agreeth not with the old.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> <woc>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> <woc>But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> <woc>No man also having drunk old <i>wine</i> straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</woc>
