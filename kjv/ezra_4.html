    <b>15</b> That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city <i>is</i> a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.

    <b>23</b> Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter <i>was</i> read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
