    <b>29</b> And it came to pass, that at midnight the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that <i>was</i> in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for <i>there was</i> not a house where <i>there was</i> not one dead.

<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, <i>and</i> get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, as ye have said.

<div class="verse" id="v37">
