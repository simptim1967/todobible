    <b>1</b> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name <i>was</i> Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And he had two wives; the name of the one <i>was</i> Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, <i>were</i> there.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had shut up her womb.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had shut up her womb.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And <i>as</i> he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? <i>am</i> not I better to thee than ten sons?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And she <i>was</i> in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and wept sore.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And she vowed a vow, and said, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, that Eli marked her mouth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I <i>am</i> a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant <i>thee</i> thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more <i>sad</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> remembered her.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, <i>saying</i>, Because I have asked him of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, <i>I will not go up</i> until the child be weaned, and <i>then</i> I will bring him, that he may appear before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and there abide for ever.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> in Shiloh: and the child <i>was</i> young.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And she said, Oh my lord, <i>as</i> thy soul liveth, my lord, I <i>am</i> the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> For this child I prayed; and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Therefore also I have lent him to the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>. And he worshipped the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> there.
