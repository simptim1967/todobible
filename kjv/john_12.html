    <b>1</b> Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's <i>son</i>, which should betray him,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Then said Jesus, <span style="color:red;">Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <span style="color:red;">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed <i>is</i> the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and <i>that</i> they had done these things unto him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And Jesus answered them, saying, <span style="color:red;">The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <span style="color:red;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <span style="color:red;">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <span style="color:red;">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will <i>my</i> Father honour.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <span style="color:red;">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <span style="color:red;">Father, glorify thy name.</span> Then came there a voice from heaven, <i>saying</i>, I have both glorified <i>it</i>, and will glorify <i>it</i> again.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard <i>it</i>, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Jesus answered and said, <span style="color:red;">This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> <span style="color:red;">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <span style="color:red;">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <i>men</i> unto me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> This he said, signifying what death he should die.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, <span style="color:red;">The Son of man must be lifted up?</span> who is this Son of man?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> Then Jesus said unto them, <span style="color:red;">Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> <span style="color:red;">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</span> These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with <i>their</i> eyes, nor understand with <i>their</i> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <i>him</i>, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> Jesus cried and said, <span style="color:red;">He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> <span style="color:red;">And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> <span style="color:red;">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> <span style="color:red;">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> <span style="color:red;">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> <span style="color:red;">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> <span style="color:red;">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</span>
