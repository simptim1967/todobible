    <b>1</b> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to <i>her</i> husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of <i>her</i> husband.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> So then if, while <i>her</i> husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, <i>even</i> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not <i>in</i> the oldness of the letter.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> What shall we say then? <i>Is</i> the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin <i>was</i> dead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the commandment, which <i>was ordained</i> to life, I found <i>to be</i> unto death.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew <i>me</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Wherefore the law <i>is</i> holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that <i>it is</i> good.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but <i>how</i> to perform that which is good I find not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
