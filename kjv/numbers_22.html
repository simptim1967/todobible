</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which <i>is</i> by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:

<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

    <b>8</b> And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

    <b>18</b> And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> my God, to do less or more.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">

<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants <i>were</i> with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And the ass saw the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> But the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall <i>being</i> on this side, and a wall on that side.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And when the ass saw the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> went further, and stood in a narrow place, where <i>was</i> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And when the ass saw the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And the ass said unto Balaam, <i>Am</i> not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since <i>I was</i> thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Then the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because <i>thy</i> way is perverse before me:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And Balaam said unto the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which <i>is</i> in the border of Arnon, which <i>is</i> in the utmost coast.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that <i>were</i> with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost <i>part</i> of the people.
