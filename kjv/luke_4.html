    <b>21</b> And he began to say unto them, <woc>This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And he said, <woc>Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, <i>a city</i> of Sidon, unto a woman <i>that was</i> a widow.</woc>

    <b>27</b> <woc>And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.</woc>

    <b>28</b> And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,

<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.

<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> But he passing through the midst of them went his way,

<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Saying, Let <i>us</i> alone; what have we to do with thee, <i>thou</i> Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.

<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <woc>Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</woc> And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.

<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word <i>is</i> this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.

<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking <i>them</i> suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And he said unto them, <woc>I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</woc>
