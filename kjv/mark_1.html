    <b>1</b> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And there came a voice from heaven, <i>saying</i>, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And saying, <woc>The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And Jesus said unto them, <woc>Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the <i>son</i> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> Saying, Let <i>us</i> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <woc>Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine <i>is</i> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And all the city was gathered together at the door.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And when they had found him, they said unto him, All <i>men</i> seek for thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <i>his</i> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, <woc>I will; be thou clean.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And saith unto him, <woc>See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> But he went out, and began to publish <i>it</i> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
