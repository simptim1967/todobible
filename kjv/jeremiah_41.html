<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.

<div class="verse" id="v3">

<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And it was <i>so</i>, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, <i>and cast them</i> into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that <i>were</i> with him.

<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.

<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, <i>was</i> it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: <i>and</i> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with <i>them that were</i> slain.

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that <i>were</i> in Mizpah, <i>even</i> the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
