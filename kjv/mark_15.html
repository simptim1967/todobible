    <b>1</b> And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried <i>him</i> away, and delivered <i>him</i> to Pilate.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, <woc>Thou sayest <i>it</i>.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Now at <i>that</i> feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And there was <i>one</i> named Barabbas, <i>which lay</i> bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire <i>him to do</i> as he had ever done unto them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do <i>unto him</i> whom ye call the King of the Jews?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And they cried out again, Crucify him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And <i>so</i> Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged <i>him</i>, to be crucified.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his <i>head</i>,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing <i>their</i> knees worshipped him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received <i>it</i> not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <i>it</i> in three days,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <woc>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</woc> which is, being interpreted, <woc>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And some of them that stood by, when they heard <i>it</i>, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put <i>it</i> on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling <i>unto him</i> the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> And when he knew <i>it</i> of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> And Mary Magdalene and Mary <i>the mother</i> of Joses beheld where he was laid.
