    <b>1</b> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was <i>so</i>, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city <i>art</i> thou? And he said, Thy servant <i>is</i> of one of the tribes of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <i>are</i> good and right; but <i>there is</i> no man <i>deputed</i> of the king to hear thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And it was <i>so</i>, that when any man came nigh <i>to him</i> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, in Hebron.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, <i>that were</i> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, <i>even</i> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And David said unto all his servants that <i>were</i> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <i>else</i> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants <i>are ready to do</i> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, <i>which were</i> concubines, to keep the house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou <i>art</i> a stranger, and also an exile.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Whereas thou camest <i>but</i> yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth <i>be</i> with thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And Ittai answered the king, and said, <i>As</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> liveth, and <i>as</i> my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that <i>were</i> with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites <i>were</i> with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, he will bring me again, and shew me <i>both</i> it, and his habitation:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, <i>here am</i> I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> The king said also unto Zadok the priest, <i>Art not</i> thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And David went up by the ascent of <i>mount</i> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that <i>was</i> with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And <i>one</i> told David, saying, Ahithophel <i>is</i> among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And it came to pass, that <i>when</i> David was come to the top <i>of the mount</i>, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; <i>as</i> I <i>have been</i> thy father's servant hitherto, so <i>will</i> I now also <i>be</i> thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And <i>hast thou</i> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, <i>that</i> what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell <i>it</i> to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> Behold, <i>they have</i> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's <i>son</i>, and Jonathan Abiathar's <i>son</i>; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
