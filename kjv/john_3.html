    <b>1</b> There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Jesus answered and said unto him, <woc>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Jesus answered, <woc>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <i>of</i> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> <woc>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> <woc>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <woc>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Jesus answered and said unto him, <woc>Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> <woc>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</woc>

    <b>12</b> <woc>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you <i>of</i> heavenly things?</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> <woc>And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <i>even</i> the Son of man which is in heaven.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> <woc>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v18">

<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <woc>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</woc>

    <b>22</b> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> For John was not yet cast into prison.

<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Then there arose a question between <i>some</i> of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all <i>men</i> come to him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.

    <b>29</b> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.

    <b>30</b> He must increase, but I <i>must</i> decrease.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.

<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure <i>unto him</i>.

<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
