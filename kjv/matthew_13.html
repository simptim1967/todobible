    <b>1</b> The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, <woc>Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> <woc>And when he sowed, some <i>seeds</i> fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> <woc>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> <woc>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> <woc>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <woc>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> <woc>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> He answered and said unto them, <woc>Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <woc>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> <woc>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> <woc>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> <woc>For this people's heart is waxed gross, and <i>their</i> ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with <i>their</i> eyes, and hear with <i>their</i> ears, and should understand with <i>their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> <woc>But blessed <i>are</i> your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> <woc>For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous <i>men</i> have desired to see <i>those things</i> which ye see, and have not seen <i>them</i>; and to hear <i>those things</i> which ye hear, and have not heard <i>them</i>.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <woc>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth <i>it</i> not, then cometh the wicked <i>one</i>, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> <woc>But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> <woc>Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <woc>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <woc>But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth <i>it</i>; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <woc>The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <woc>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <woc>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <woc>He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <woc>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <woc>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <woc>The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <woc>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Another parable spake he unto them; <woc>The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> He answered and said unto them, <woc>He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> <woc>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked <i>one</i>;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> <woc>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> <woc>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> <woc>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> <woc>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> <woc>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> <woc>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> <woc>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> <woc>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> <woc>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> <woc>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> <woc>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> <woc>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> Jesus saith unto them, <woc>Have ye understood all these things?</woc> They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> Then said he unto them, <woc>Therefore every scribe <i>which is</i> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <i>that is</i> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure <i>things</i> new and old.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v54">
    <b>54</b> And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this <i>man</i> this wisdom, and <i>these</i> mighty works?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v55">
    <b>55</b> Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v56">
    <b>56</b> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this <i>man</i> all these things?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v57">
    <b>57</b> And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, <woc>A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v58">
    <b>58</b> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
