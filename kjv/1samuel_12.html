    <b>1</b> And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons <i>are</i> with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Behold, here I <i>am</i>: witness against me before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received <i>any</i> bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And he said unto them, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> <i>is</i> witness against you, and his anointed <i>is</i> witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, <i>He is</i> witness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And Samuel said unto the people, <i>It is</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> of all the righteous acts of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, which he did to you and to your fathers.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, then the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And when they forgat the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And they cried unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> your God <i>was</i> your king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, <i>and</i> whom ye have desired! and, behold, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath set a king over you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> If ye will fear the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> your God:

    <b>16</b> Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> will do before your eyes.

    <b>17</b> <i>Is it</i> not wheat harvest to day?

<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> So Samuel called unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> and Samuel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins <i>this</i> evil, to ask us a king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, but serve the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> with all your heart;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And turn ye not aside: for <i>then should ye go</i> after vain <i>things</i>, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they <i>are</i> vain.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> For the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> to make you his people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> Only fear the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great <i>things</i> he hath done for you.
