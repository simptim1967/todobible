    <b>1</b> Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, <i>one</i> of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Arise; for <i>this</i> matter <i>belongeth</i> unto thee: we also <i>will be</i> with thee: be of good courage, and do <i>it</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and <i>when</i> he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It <i>was</i> the ninth month, on the twentieth <i>day</i> of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of <i>this</i> matter, and for the great rain.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.

    <b>11</b> Now therefore make confession unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.

    <b>16</b> And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, <i>with</i> certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by <i>their</i> names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
