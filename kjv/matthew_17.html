<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.

    <b>3</b> And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And when the disciples heard <i>it</i>, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.

<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, <woc>Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Jesus answered and said unto them, <woc>Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.</woc>

    <b>13</b> Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.

    <b>20</b> And Jesus said unto them, <woc>Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</woc>

    <b>25</b> He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, <woc>What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, <woc>Then are the children free.</woc>
