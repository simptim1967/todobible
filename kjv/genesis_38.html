<div class="verse" id="v8">

<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled <i>it</i> on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the thing which he did displeased the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: wherefore he slew him also.

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren <i>did</i>. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which <i>is</i> by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> When Judah saw her, he thought her <i>to be</i> an harlot; because she had covered her face.

<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she <i>was</i> his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And he said, I will send <i>thee</i> a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give <i>me</i> a pledge, till thou send <i>it</i>?

    <b>18</b> And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that <i>is</i> in thine hand. And he gave <i>it</i> her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

<div class="verse" id="v19">

<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where <i>is</i> the harlot, that <i>was</i> openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this <i>place</i>.

<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, <i>that</i> there was no harlot in this <i>place</i>.

    <b>23</b> And Judah said, Let her take <i>it</i> to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she <i>is</i> with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> When she <i>was</i> brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these <i>are, am</i> I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose <i>are</i> these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And Judah acknowledged <i>them</i>, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.

<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins <i>were</i> in her womb.

<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And it came to pass, when she travailed, that <i>the one</i> put out <i>his</i> hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? <i>this</i> breach <i>be</i> upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.

<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
