    <b>1</b> For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Now consider how great this man <i>was</i>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <i>receiveth them</i>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <i>was there</i> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> For <i>it is</i> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> For he testifieth, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <i>did</i>; by the which we draw nigh unto God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And inasmuch as not without an oath <i>he was made priest</i>:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> But this <i>man</i>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> For such an high priest became us, <i>who is</i> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <i>maketh</i> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
