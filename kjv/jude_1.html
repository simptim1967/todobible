<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort <i>you</i> that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Likewise also these <i>filthy</i> dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds <i>they are</i> without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,

<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling <i>words</i>, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

    <b>19</b> These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.

    <b>21</b> Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
