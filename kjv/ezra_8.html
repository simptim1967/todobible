    <b>15</b> And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.

<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;

<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God <i>is</i> upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath <i>is</i> against all them that forsake him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, <i>even</i> the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel <i>there</i> present, had offered:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, <i>and</i> of gold an hundred talents;

<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And I said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> holy unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; the vessels <i>are</i> holy also; and the silver and the gold <i>are</i> a freewill offering unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of your fathers.

<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Watch ye, and keep <i>them</i>, until ye weigh <i>them</i> before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring <i>them</i> to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth <i>day</i> of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.

<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> By number <i>and</i> by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> <i>Also</i> the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats <i>for</i> a sin offering: all <i>this was</i> a burnt offering unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
