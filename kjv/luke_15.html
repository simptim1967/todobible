    <b>11</b> And he said, <woc>A certain man had two sons:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <woc>And the younger of them said to <i>his</i> father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth <i>to me</i>. And he divided unto them <i>his</i> living.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> <woc>And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> <woc>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.</woc>

    <b>15</b> <woc>And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. </woc>

    <b>17</b> <woc>And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> <woc>And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</woc>

    <b>22</b> <woc>But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put <i>it</i> on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on <i>his</i> feet:</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <woc>And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill <i>it</i>; and let us eat, and be merry:</woc>

    <b>25</b> <woc>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <woc>And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <woc>And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <woc>And he answering said to <i>his</i> father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <woc>But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</woc>

    <b>31</b> <woc>And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</woc>
