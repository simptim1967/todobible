    <b>1</b> Be ye followers of me, even as I also <i>am</i> of Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered <i>them</i> to you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman <i>is</i> the man; and the head of Christ <i>is</i> God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Every man praying or prophesying, having <i>his</i> head covered, dishonoureth his head.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with <i>her</i> head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> For a man indeed ought not to cover <i>his</i> head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For this cause ought the woman to have power on <i>her</i> head because of the angels.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> For as the woman <i>is</i> of the man, even so <i>is</i> the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for <i>her</i> hair is given her for a covering.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Now in this that I declare <i>unto you</i> I praise <i>you</i> not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> When ye come together therefore into one place, <i>this</i> is not to eat the Lord's supper.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> For in eating every one taketh before <i>other</i> his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise <i>you</i> not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the <i>same</i> night in which he was betrayed took bread:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And when he had given thanks, he brake <i>it</i>, and said, <woc>Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> After the same manner also <i>he took</i> the cup, when he had supped, saying, <woc>This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <i>it</i>, in remembrance of me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink <i>this</i> cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <i>that</i> bread, and drink of <i>that</i> cup.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> For this cause many <i>are</i> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
