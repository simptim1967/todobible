    <b>1</b> Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And the name of the man <i>was</i> Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one <i>was</i> Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had visited his people in giving them bread.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> grant you that ye may find rest, each <i>of you</i> in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? <i>are</i> there yet <i>any more</i> sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Turn again, my daughters, go <i>your way</i>; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, <i>if</i> I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> is gone out against me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, <i>or</i> to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people <i>shall be</i> my people, and thy God my God:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> do so to me, and more also, <i>if ought</i> but death part thee and me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, <i>Is</i> this Naomi?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> I went out full, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath brought me home again empty: why <i>then</i> call ye me Naomi, seeing the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
