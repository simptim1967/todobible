    <b>1</b> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And not only <i>so</i>, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And not only <i>so</i>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> But not as the offence, so also <i>is</i> the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, <i>which is</i> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And not as <i>it was</i> by one that sinned, <i>so is</i> the gift: for the judgment <i>was</i> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <i>is</i> of many offences unto justification.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Therefore as by the offence of one <i>judgment came</i> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <i>the free gift came</i> upon all men unto justification of life.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
