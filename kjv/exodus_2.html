    <b>1</b> And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took <i>to wife</i> a daughter of Levi.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he <i>was a</i> goodly <i>child</i>, she hid him three months.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid <i>it</i> in the flags by the river's brink.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash <i>herself</i> at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And when she had opened <i>it</i>, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This <i>is one</i> of the Hebrews' children.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give <i>thee</i> thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that <i>there was</i> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew <i>water</i>, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How <i>is it that</i> ye are come so soon to day?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew <i>water</i> enough for us, and watered the flock.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And he said unto his daughters, And where <i>is</i> he? why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And she bare <i>him</i> a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto <i>them</i>.
