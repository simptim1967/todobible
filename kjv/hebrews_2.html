    <b>1</b> Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let <i>them</i> slip.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard <i>him</i>;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> God also bearing <i>them</i> witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing <i>that is</i> not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For it became him, for whom <i>are</i> all things, and by whom <i>are</i> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified <i>are</i> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,

    <b>12</b> Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.

    <b>13</b> And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
</div>

    <b>15</b> And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.

    <b>16</b> For verily he took not on <i>him the nature of</i> angels; but he took on <i>him</i> the seed of Abraham.

<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto <i>his</i> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
