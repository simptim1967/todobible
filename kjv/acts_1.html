<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And, being assembled together with <i>them</i>, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, <woc>which</woc>, <i>saith he</i>, <woc>ye have heard of me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> <woc>For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And he said unto them, <woc>It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <woc>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;

    <b>12</b> Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James <i>the son</i> of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas <i>the brother</i> of James.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

    <b>17</b> For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.

<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.

    <b>21</b> Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

    <b>23</b> And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
