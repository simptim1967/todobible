    <b>2</b> Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And, being assembled together with <i>them</i>, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, <span style="color:red;">which</span>, <i>saith he</i>, <span style="color:red;">ye have heard of me.</span>

<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And he said unto them, <span style="color:red;">It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</span>

    <b>8</b> <span style="color:red;">But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</span>

    <b>9</b> And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James <i>the son</i> of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas <i>the brother</i> of James.

<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.

    <b>21</b> Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
