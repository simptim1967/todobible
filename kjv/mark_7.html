    <b>4</b> And <i>when they come</i> from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, <i>as</i> the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.

<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?

    <b>6</b> He answered and said unto them, <woc>Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with <i>their</i> lips, but their heart is far from me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">

    <b>10</b> <woc>For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</woc>

    <b>11</b> <woc>But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother<i>, It is</i> Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <i>he shall be free</i>.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> <woc>There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <woc>Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</woc>

    <b>20</b> And he said, <woc>That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</woc>

    <b>24</b> And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know <i>it</i>: but he could not be hid.

<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> For a <i>certain</i> woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:

<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> But Jesus said unto her, <woc>Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast <i>it</i> unto the dogs.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.

<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And he said unto her, <woc>For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, <woc>Ephphatha,</woc> that is, <woc>Be opened.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published <i>it</i>;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
