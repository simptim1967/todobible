    <b>1</b> What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath <i>whereof</i> to glory; but not before God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> <i>Saying</i>, Blessed <i>are</i> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Blessed <i>is</i> the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> <i>Cometh</i> this blessedness then upon the circumcision <i>only</i>, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <i>he had yet</i> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which <i>he had</i> being <i>yet</i> uncircumcised.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, <i>was</i> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> For if they which are of the law <i>be</i> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, <i>there is</i> no transgression.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Therefore <i>it is</i> of faith, that <i>it might be</i> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, <i>even</i> God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
