    <b>1</b> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name <i>was</i> Manoah; and his wife <i>was</i> barren, and bare not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou <i>art</i> barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean <i>thing</i>:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance <i>was</i> like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he <i>was</i>, neither told he me his name:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean <i>thing</i>: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Then Manoah intreated the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband <i>was</i> not with her.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the <i>other</i> day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, <i>Art</i> thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I <i>am</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and <i>how</i> shall we do unto him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> She may not eat of any <i>thing</i> that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean <i>thing</i>: all that I commanded her let her observe.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Manoah said unto the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>. For Manoah knew not that he <i>was</i> an angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And Manoah said unto the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, What <i>is</i> thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it <i>is</i> secret?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered <i>it</i> upon a rock unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: and <i>the angel</i> did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on <i>it</i>, and fell on their faces to the ground.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> But the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he <i>was</i> an angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> But his wife said unto him, If the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these <i>things</i>, nor would as at this time have told us <i>such things</i> as these.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> blessed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And the Spirit of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
