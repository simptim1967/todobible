    <b>3</b> And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what <i>shall be</i> the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?

<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And Jesus answered and said unto them, <woc>Take heed that no man deceive you.</woc>
