<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And the anger of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all <i>their</i> days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And Jehoahaz besought the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.

<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> (And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.

<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, <i>but</i> walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)

<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.

<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows.

<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened <i>it</i>. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot.

<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And he said, Take the arrows. And he took <i>them</i>. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.

    <b>19</b> And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed <i>it</i>: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria <i>but</i> thrice.

<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.

    <b>23</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.

<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.
