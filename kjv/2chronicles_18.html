</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I <i>am</i> as thou <i>art</i>, and my people as thy people; and <i>we will be</i> with thee in the war.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> to day.

<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver <i>it</i> into the king's hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> But Jehoshaphat said, <i>Is there</i> not here a prophet of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> besides, that we might enquire of him?

<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <i>There is</i> yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same <i>is</i> Micaiah the son of Imla.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And the king of Israel called for one <i>of his</i> officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in <i>their</i> robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> shall deliver <i>it</i> into the hand of the king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets <i>declare</i> good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And Micaiah said, <i>As</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said, These have no master; let them return <i>therefore</i> every man to his house in peace.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee <i>that</i> he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; I saw the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and <i>on</i> his left.

<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and said, I will entice him. And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto him, Wherewith?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And <i>the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span></i> said, Thou shalt entice <i>him</i>, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do <i>even</i> so.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Now therefore, behold, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath spoken evil against thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> from me to speak unto thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this <i>fellow</i> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, <i>then</i> hath not the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that <i>were</i> with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It <i>is</i> the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> helped him; and God moved them <i>to depart</i> from him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And a <i>certain</i> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed <i>himself</i> up in <i>his</i> chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.
