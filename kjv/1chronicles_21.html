    <b>1</b> And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know <i>it</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Joab answered, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> make his people an hundred times so many more as they <i>be</i>: but, my lord the king, <i>are</i> they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all <i>they of</i> Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah <i>was</i> four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, I offer thee three <i>things</i>: choose thee one of them, that I may do <i>it</i> unto thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, Choose thee
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh <i>thee</i>; or else three days the sword of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; for very great <i>are</i> his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> So the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders <i>of Israel, who were</i> clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And David said unto God, <i>Is it</i> not I <i>that</i> commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but <i>as for</i> these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Then the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with <i>his</i> face to the ground.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of <i>this</i> threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And Ornan said unto David, Take <i>it</i> to thee, and let my lord the king do <i>that which is</i> good in his eyes: lo, I give <i>thee</i> the oxen <i>also</i> for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> thine for the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And David built there an altar unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> At that time when David saw that the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> For the tabernacle of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, <i>were</i> at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
