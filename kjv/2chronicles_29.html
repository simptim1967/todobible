<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Now they began on the first <i>day</i> of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: so they sanctified the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.

<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.

<div class="verse" id="v19">

    <b>20</b> Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.

<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled <i>it</i> on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And they brought forth the he goats <i>for</i> the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded <i>that</i> the burnt offering and the sin offering <i>should be made</i> for all Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And he set the Levites in the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for <i>so was</i> the commandment of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> by his prophets.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> began <i>also</i> with the trumpets, and with the instruments <i>ordained</i> by David king of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: <i>and</i> all <i>this continued</i> until the burnt offering was finished.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, <i>and</i> two hundred lambs: all these <i>were</i> for a burnt offering to the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And the consecrated things <i>were</i> six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the <i>other</i> priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites <i>were</i> more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And also the burnt offerings <i>were</i> in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for <i>every</i> burnt offering. So the service of the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was set in order.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was <i>done</i> suddenly.
