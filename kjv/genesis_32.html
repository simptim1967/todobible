    <b>1</b> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And when Jacob saw them, he said, This <i>is</i> God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that <i>was</i> with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, <i>and</i> the mother with the children.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And he delivered <i>them</i> into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose <i>art</i> thou? and whither goest thou? and whose <i>are</i> these before thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Then thou shalt say, <i>They be</i> thy servant Jacob's; it <i>is</i> a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he <i>is</i> behind us.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob <i>is</i> behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And he said unto him, What <i>is</i> thy name? And he said, Jacob.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And Jacob asked <i>him</i>, and said, Tell <i>me</i>, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> Therefore the children of Israel eat not <i>of</i> the sinew which shrank, which <i>is</i> upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
