    <b>1</b> And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And devout men carried Stephen <i>to his burial</i>, and made great lamentation over him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed <i>them</i> to prison.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <i>with them</i>: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And there was great joy in that city.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Then laid they <i>their</i> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <i>in</i> the bond of iniquity.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And Philip ran thither to <i>him</i>, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And as they went on <i>their</i> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <i>here is</i> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
