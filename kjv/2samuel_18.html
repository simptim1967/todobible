    <b>1</b> And David numbered the people that <i>were</i> with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now <i>thou art</i> worth ten thousand of us: therefore now <i>it is</i> better that thou succour us out of the city.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, <i>Deal</i> gently for my sake with the young man, <i>even</i> with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand <i>men</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that <i>was</i> under him went away.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And a certain man saw <i>it</i>, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest <i>him</i>, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten <i>shekels</i> of silver, and a girdle.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand <i>shekels</i> of silver in mine hand, <i>yet</i> would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none <i>touch</i> the young man Absalom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against <i>me</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he <i>was</i> yet alive in the midst of the oak.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which <i>is</i> in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath avenged him of his enemies.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> But howsoever, <i>said he</i>, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he <i>be</i> alone, <i>there is</i> tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold <i>another</i> man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He <i>is</i> a good man, and cometh with good tidings.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and <i>me</i> thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what <i>it was</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And the king said <i>unto him</i>, Turn aside, <i>and</i> stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do <i>thee</i> hurt, be as <i>that</i> young man <i>is</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
