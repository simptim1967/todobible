    <b>1</b> Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Especially <i>because I know</i> thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Unto which <i>promise</i> our twelve tribes, instantly serving <i>God</i> day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against <i>them</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled <i>them</i> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted <i>them</i> even unto strange cities.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, <woc>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <i>it is</i> hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, <woc>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> <woc>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> <woc>Delivering thee from the people, and <i>from</i> the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>To open their eyes, <i>and</i> to turn <i>them</i> from darkness to light, and <i>from</i> the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and <i>then</i> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill <i>me</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> That Christ should suffer, <i>and</i> that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
