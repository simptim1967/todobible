    <b>1</b> And it came to pass <i>after</i> many days, that the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And <i>there was</i> a sore famine in Samaria.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Ahab called Obadiah, which <i>was</i> the governor of <i>his</i> house. (Now Obadiah feared the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> greatly:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> For it was <i>so</i>, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, <i>Art</i> thou that my lord Elijah?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And he answered him, I <i>am</i>: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <i>is here</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> <i>As</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, <i>He is</i> not <i>there</i>; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <i>is here</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And it shall come to pass, <i>as soon as</i> I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> shall carry thee whither I know not; and <i>so</i> when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> from my youth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, how I hid an hundred men of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>'s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <i>is here</i>: and he shall slay me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Elijah said, <i>As</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, <i>Art</i> thou he that troubleth Israel?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and thou hast followed Baalim.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Now therefore send, <i>and</i> gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> <i>be</i> God, follow him: but if Baal, <i>then</i> follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Then said Elijah unto the people, I, <i>even</i> I only, remain a prophet of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; but Baal's prophets <i>are</i> four hundred and fifty men.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay <i>it</i> on wood, and put no fire <i>under</i>: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay <i>it</i> on wood, and put no fire <i>under</i>:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress <i>it</i> first; for ye <i>are</i> many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire <i>under</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed <i>it</i>, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But <i>there was</i> no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he <i>is</i> a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, <i>or</i> peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the <i>time</i> of the offering of the <i>evening</i> sacrifice, that <i>there was</i> neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> <i>that was</i> broken down.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid <i>him</i> on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour <i>it</i> on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And he said, Do <i>it</i> the second time. And they did <i>it</i> the second time. And he said, Do <i>it</i> the third time. And they did <i>it</i> the third time.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And it came to pass at <i>the time of</i> the offering of the <i>evening</i> sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou <i>art</i> God in Israel, and <i>that</i> I <i>am</i> thy servant, and <i>that</i> I have done all these things at thy word.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> Hear me, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, hear me, that this people may know that thou <i>art</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God, and <i>that</i> thou hast turned their heart back again.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> Then the fire of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that <i>was</i> in the trench.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And when all the people saw <i>it</i>, they fell on their faces: and they said, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, he <i>is</i> the God; the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, he <i>is</i> the God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for <i>there is</i> a sound of abundance of rain.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, <i>There is</i> nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare <i>thy chariot</i>, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And the hand of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
