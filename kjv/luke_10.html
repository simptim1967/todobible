    <b>1</b> After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Therefore said he unto them, <woc>The harvest truly <i>is</i> great, but the labourers <i>are</i> few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.</woc>

    <b>11</b> <woc>Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <woc>But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> <woc>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</woc>

    <b>17</b> And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.

<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, <woc>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <woc>All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and <i>he</i> to whom the Son will reveal <i>him</i>. </woc>

<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And he turned him unto <i>his</i> disciples, and said privately, <woc>Blessed <i>are</i> the eyes which see the things that ye see:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <woc>For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen <i>them</i>; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard <i>them</i>. </woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> He said unto him, <woc>What is written in the law? how readest thou?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And he said unto him, <woc>Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And Jesus answering said, <woc>A certain <i>man</i> went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded <i>him</i>, and departed, leaving <i>him</i> half dead.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> <woc>And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <woc>And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked <i>on him</i>, and passed by on the other side.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> <woc>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion <i>on him</i>,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> <woc>And went to <i>him</i>, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> <woc>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave <i>them</i> to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> <woc>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, <woc>Go, and do thou likewise.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And Jesus answered and said unto her, <woc>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> <woc>But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</woc>
