    <b>1</b> After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews <i>that</i> Jesus <i>was</i> Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook <i>his</i> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood <i>be</i> upon your own heads; I <i>am</i> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And he departed thence, and entered into a certain <i>man's</i> house, named Justus, <i>one</i> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, <woc>Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> <woc>For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And he continued <i>there</i> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Saying, This <i>fellow</i> persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And when Paul was now about to open <i>his</i> mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O <i>ye</i> Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> But if it be a question of words and names, and <i>of</i> your law, look ye <i>to it</i>; for I will be no judge of such <i>matters</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And he drave them from the judgment seat.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat <i>him</i> before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And Paul <i>after this</i> tarried <i>there</i> yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn <i>his</i> head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> When they desired <i>him</i> to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And after he had spent some time <i>there</i>, he departed, and went over <i>all</i> the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, <i>and</i> mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto <i>them</i>, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> For he mightily convinced the Jews, <i>and that</i> publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
