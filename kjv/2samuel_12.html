    <b>1</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> The rich <i>man</i> had exceeding many flocks and herds:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> But the poor <i>man</i> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, <i>As</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> liveth, the man that hath done this <i>thing</i> shall surely die:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And Nathan said to David, Thou <i>art</i> the man. Thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <i>that had been</i> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife <i>to be</i> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give <i>them</i> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> For thou didst <i>it</i> secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>. And Nathan said unto David, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> to blaspheme, the child also <i>that is</i> born unto thee shall surely die.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Nathan departed unto his house. And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And the elders of his house arose, <i>and went</i> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed <i>himself</i>, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Then said his servants unto him, What thing <i>is</i> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <i>while it was</i> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell <i>whether</i> <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>God</span> will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> loved him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof <i>was</i> a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was <i>set</i> on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And he brought forth the people that <i>were</i> therein, and put <i>them</i> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
