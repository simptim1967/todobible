    <b>3</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">

    <b>5</b> And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for <i>there is</i> no bread, neither <i>is there any</i> water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.

<div class="verse" id="v6">

    <b>24</b> And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon <i>was</i> strong.

    <b>25</b> And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.

    <b>29</b> Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
