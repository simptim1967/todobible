</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in <i>so</i> doing.

<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And now, <i>though</i> thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, <i>yet</i> wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?

    <b>31</b> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what <i>is</i> thine with me, and take <i>it</i> to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found <i>them</i> not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found <i>them</i> not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women <i>is</i> upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What <i>is</i> my trespass? what <i>is</i> my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set <i>it</i> here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> That which was torn <i>of beasts</i> I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, <i>whether</i> stolen by day, or stolen by night.

    <b>42</b> Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked <i>thee</i> yesternight.

<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, <i>These</i> daughters <i>are</i> my daughters, and <i>these</i> children <i>are</i> my children, and <i>these</i> cattle <i>are</i> my cattle, and all that thou seest <i>is</i> mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
