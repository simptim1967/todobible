    <b>1</b> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring <i>certain</i> of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Children in whom <i>was</i> no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as <i>had</i> ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel <i>the name</i> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which <i>are</i> of your sort? then shall ye make <i>me</i> endanger my head to the king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And in all matters of wisdom <i>and</i> understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <i>and</i> astrologers that <i>were</i> in all his realm.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And Daniel continued <i>even</i> unto the first year of king Cyrus.
