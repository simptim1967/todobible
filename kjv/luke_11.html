    <b>37</b> And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.

<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And when the Pharisee saw <i>it</i>, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.

<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And the Lord said unto him, <woc>Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</woc>

    <b>40</b> <woc><i>Ye</i> fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> <woc>But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> <woc>Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v44">

<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.

<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And he said, <woc>Woe unto you also, <i>ye</i> lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> <woc>Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> <woc>Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> <woc>Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and <i>some</i> of them they shall slay and persecute:</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v50">

<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> <woc>Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</woc>
