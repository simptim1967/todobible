<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <span style="color:red;">The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas <i>is</i> here.</span>

<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> <span style="color:red;">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth <i>it</i> in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> <span style="color:red;">The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when <i>thine eye</i> is evil, thy body also <i>is</i> full of darkness.</span>

<div class="verse" id="v35">

    <b>37</b> And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.

<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And the Lord said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</span>

<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> <span style="color:red;">But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> <span style="color:red;">Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</span>

<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> <span style="color:red;">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over <i>them</i> are not aware <i>of them</i>.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.

<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> <span style="color:red;">Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> <span style="color:red;">Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> <span style="color:red;">Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and <i>some</i> of them they shall slay and persecute:</span>

<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> <span style="color:red;">Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</span>
