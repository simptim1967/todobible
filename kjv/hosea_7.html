    <b>1</b> When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, <i>and</i> the troop of robbers spoileth without.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And they consider not in their hearts <i>that</i> I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.
</div>

    <b>3</b> They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
</div>

    <b>4</b> They <i>are</i> all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, <i>who</i> ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> In the day of our king the princes have made <i>him</i> sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

    <b>7</b> They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: <i>there is</i> none among them that calleth unto me.

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
