    <b>1</b> And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> <span style="color:red;">Ye know that after two days is <i>the feast of</i> the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill <i>him</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> But they said, Not on the feast <i>day</i>, lest there be an uproar among the people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat <i>at meat</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> But when his disciples saw <i>it</i>, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose <i>is</i> this waste?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> When Jesus understood <i>it</i>, he said unto them, <span style="color:red;">Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> <span style="color:red;">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <span style="color:red;">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did <i>it</i> for my burial.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> <span style="color:red;">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, <i>there</i> shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And said <i>unto them</i>, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Now the first <i>day</i> of the <i>feast of</i> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And he said, <span style="color:red;">Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And as they did eat, he said, <span style="color:red;">Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And he answered and said, <span style="color:red;">He that dippeth <i>his</i> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <span style="color:red;">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Thou hast said.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed <i>it</i>, and brake <i>it</i>, and gave <i>it</i> to the disciples, and said, <span style="color:red;">Take, eat; this is my body.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, <span style="color:red;">Drink ye all of it;</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <span style="color:red;">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <span style="color:red;">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Then saith Jesus unto them, <span style="color:red;">All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <span style="color:red;">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Peter answered and said unto him, Though all <i>men</i> shall be offended because of thee, <i>yet</i> will I never be offended.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Jesus said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, <span style="color:red;">Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> Then saith he unto them, <span style="color:red;">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span style="color:red;">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <i>wilt</i>.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, <span style="color:red;">What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> <span style="color:red;">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, <span style="color:red;">O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, <span style="color:red;">Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> <span style="color:red;">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> And Jesus said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Friend, wherefore art thou come?</span> Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out <i>his</i> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> Then said Jesus unto him, <span style="color:red;">Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> <span style="color:red;">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v54">
    <b>54</b> <span style="color:red;">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v55">
    <b>55</b> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, <span style="color:red;">Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v56">
    <b>56</b> <span style="color:red;">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</span> Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v57">
    <b>57</b> And they that had laid hold on Jesus led <i>him</i> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v58">
    <b>58</b> But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v59">
    <b>59</b> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v60">
    <b>60</b> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, <i>yet</i> found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v61">
    <b>61</b> And said, This <i>fellow</i> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v62">
    <b>62</b> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what <i>is it which</i> these witness against thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v63">
    <b>63</b> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v64">
    <b>64</b> Jesus saith unto him, <span style="color:red;">Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v65">
    <b>65</b> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v66">
    <b>66</b> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v67">
    <b>67</b> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote <i>him</i> with the palms of their hands,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v68">
    <b>68</b> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v69">
    <b>69</b> Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v70">
    <b>70</b> But he denied before <i>them</i> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v71">
    <b>71</b> And when he was gone out into the porch, another <i>maid</i> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This <i>fellow</i> was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v72">
    <b>72</b> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v73">
    <b>73</b> And after a while came unto <i>him</i> they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art <i>one</i> of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v74">
    <b>74</b> Then began he to curse and to swear, <i>saying</i>, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v75">
    <b>75</b> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> And he went out, and wept bitterly.
