    <b>1</b> Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <i>it</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, <span style="color:red;">I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, <span style="color:red;">Weep not.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare <i>him</i> stood still. And he said, <span style="color:red;">Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And John calling <i>unto him</i> two of his disciples sent <i>them</i> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And in that same hour he cured many of <i>their</i> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <i>that were</i> blind he gave sight.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Then Jesus answering said unto them, <span style="color:red;">Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <span style="color:red;">And blessed is <i>he</i>, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, <span style="color:red;">What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <span style="color:red;">But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <span style="color:red;">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <span style="color:red;">This is <i>he</i>, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <span style="color:red;">For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And all the people that heard <i>him</i>, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And the Lord said, <span style="color:red;">Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <span style="color:red;">They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> <span style="color:red;">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> <span style="color:red;">The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> <span style="color:red;">But wisdom is justified of all her children.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that <i>Jesus</i> sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And stood at his feet behind <i>him</i> weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe <i>them</i> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <i>them</i> with the ointment.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <i>it</i>, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <i>this is</i> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And Jesus answering said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.</span> And he saith, Master, say on.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> <span style="color:red;">There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> <span style="color:red;">And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> Simon answered and said, I suppose that <i>he</i>, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Thou hast rightly judged.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, <span style="color:red;">Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped <i>them</i> with the hairs of her head.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> <span style="color:red;">Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> <span style="color:red;">My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> <span style="color:red;">Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, <i>the same</i> loveth little.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> And he said unto her, <span style="color:red;">Thy sins are forgiven.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> And he said to the woman, <span style="color:red;">Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</span>
