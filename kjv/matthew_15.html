</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> But he answered and said unto them, <woc>Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> <woc>For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> <woc>But ye say, Whosoever shall say to <i>his</i> father or <i>his</i> mother, <i>It is</i> a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> <woc>And honour not his father or his mother, <i>he shall be free</i>. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> <woc><i>Ye</i> hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <woc>This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with <i>their</i> lips; but their heart is far from me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> <woc>But in vain they do worship me, teaching <i>for</i> doctrines the commandments of men.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And he called the multitude, and said unto them, <woc>Hear, and understand:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> <woc>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> But he answered and said, <woc>Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> <woc>Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</woc>

    <b>15</b> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">

<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <woc>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> <woc>These are <i>the things</i> which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</woc>

    <b>21</b> Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> But he answered and said, <woc>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</woc>

    <b>25</b> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, <woc>O woman, great <i>is</i> thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</woc> And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And great multitudes came unto him, having with them <i>those that were</i> lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> Then Jesus called his disciples <i>unto him</i>, and said, <woc>I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And Jesus saith unto them, <woc>How many loaves have ye?</woc> And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.

<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake <i>them</i>, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <i>meat</i> that was left seven baskets full.

    <b>38</b> And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.

    <b>39</b> And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
