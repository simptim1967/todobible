    <b>2</b> Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;

<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And say thou unto them, Thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel; Cursed <i>be</i> the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Which I commanded your fathers in the day <i>that</i> I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as <i>it is</i> this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Then the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day <i>that</i> I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, <i>even</i> unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded <i>them</i> to do; but they did <i>them</i> not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.

    <b>11</b> Therefore thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.

<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
