    <b>5</b> <span style="color:red;">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</span>

    <b>8</b> <span style="color:red;">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</span>

    <b>9</b> And he said unto them, <span style="color:red;">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span>

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <span style="color:red;">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and <i>their</i> sins should be forgiven them.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And he said unto them, <span style="color:red;">Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</span>

    <b>17</b> <span style="color:red;">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</span>

    <b>22</b> <span style="color:red;">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</span>

    <b>25</b> <span style="color:red;">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</span>

<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And he said, <span style="color:red;">So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</span>

<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <span style="color:red;">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <span style="color:red;">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <span style="color:red;">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And he said, <span style="color:red;">Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> <span style="color:red;"><i>It is</i> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <span style="color:red;">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear <i>it</i>.

    <b>36</b> And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.

    <b>37</b> And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.

    <b>39</b> And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, <span style="color:red;">Peace, be still.</span> And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
