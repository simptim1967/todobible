    <b>1</b> And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.

    <b>2</b> And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,

    <b>3</b> <woc>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> <woc>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> <woc>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> <woc>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</woc>

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <woc>And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And he said unto them, <woc>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all <i>these</i> things are done in parables:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <woc>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and <i>their</i> sins should be forgiven them.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> <woc>The sower soweth the word.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> <woc>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> <woc>And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> <woc>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</woc>

    <b>18</b> <woc>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <woc>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> <woc>And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive <i>it</i>, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <woc>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <woc>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</woc>

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <woc>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And he said, <woc>So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <woc>And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <woc>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <woc>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And he said, <woc>Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> <woc><i>It is</i> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <woc>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear <i>it</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, <woc>Let us pass over unto the other side.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, <woc>Peace, be still.</woc> And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
