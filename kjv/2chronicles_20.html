    <b>2</b> Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they <i>be</i> in Hazazon-tamar, which <i>is</i> En-gedi.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask <i>help</i> of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>

<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And said, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of our fathers, <i>art</i> not thou God in heaven? and rulest <i>not</i> thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand <i>is there not</i> power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;

    <b>13</b> And all Judah stood before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.

<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> in the midst of the congregation;

<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with <i>his</i> face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, worshipping the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel with a loud voice on high.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And when they began to sing and to praise, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy <i>them</i>: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they <i>were</i> dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of <i>those</i> countries, when they had heard that the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> fought against the enemies of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: <i>he was</i> thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name <i>was</i> Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing <i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.

<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who <i>is</i> mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:

<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.
