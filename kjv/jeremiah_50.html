</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.

    <b>7</b> All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>, the habitation of justice, even the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>, the hope of their fathers.

    <b>29</b> Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>, against the Holy One of Israel.
