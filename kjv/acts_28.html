    <b>1</b> And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid <i>them</i> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And when the barbarians saw the <i>venomous</i> beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded <i>us</i> with such things as were necessary.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <i>there</i> three days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men <i>and</i> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Who, when they had examined me, would have let <i>me</i> go, because there was no cause of death in me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> But when the Jews spake against <i>it</i>, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see <i>you</i>, and to speak with <i>you</i>: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <i>his</i> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and <i>out of</i> the prophets, from morning till evening.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <i>their</i> eyes, and hear with <i>their</i> ears, and understand with <i>their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and <i>that</i> they will hear it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
