    <b>1</b> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <i>the Lord</i> of glory, with respect of persons.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one <i>point</i>, he is guilty of all.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> What <i>doth it</i> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be <i>ye</i> warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what <i>doth it</i> profit?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent <i>them</i> out another way?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
