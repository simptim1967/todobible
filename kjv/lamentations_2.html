    <b>1</b> How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, <i>and</i> cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought <i>them</i> down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> He hath cut off in <i>his</i> fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, <i>which</i> devoureth round about.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all <i>that were</i> pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <i>if it were of</i> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, as in the day of a solemn feast.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes <i>are</i> among the Gentiles: the law <i>is</i> no <i>more</i>; her prophets also find no vision from the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, <i>and</i> keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> They say to their mothers, Where <i>is</i> corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach <i>is</i> great like the sea: who can heal thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> All that pass by clap <i>their</i> hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, <i>saying, Is</i> this the city that <i>men</i> call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed <i>her</i> up: certainly this <i>is</i> the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen <i>it</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath done <i>that</i> which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused <i>thine</i> enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Behold, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, <i>and</i> children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain <i>them</i> in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, <i>and</i> not pitied.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>'s anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
