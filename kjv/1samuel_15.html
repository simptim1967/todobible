    <b>1</b> Samuel also said unto Saul, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sent me to anoint thee <i>to be</i> king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> of hosts, I remember <i>that</i> which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid <i>wait</i> for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah <i>until</i> thou comest to Shur, that <i>is</i> over against Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all <i>that was</i> good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing <i>that was</i> vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Then came the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> unto Samuel, saying,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul <i>to be</i> king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> all night.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed <i>be</i> thou of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: I have performed the commandment of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And Samuel said, What <i>meaneth</i> then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And Samuel said, When thou <i>wast</i> little in thine own sight, <i>wast</i> thou not <i>made</i> the head of the tribes of Israel, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> anointed thee king over Israel?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and have gone the way which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> thy God in Gilgal.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And Samuel said, Hath the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> <i>as great</i> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>? Behold, to obey <i>is</i> better than sacrifice, <i>and</i> to hearken than the fat of rams.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> For rebellion <i>is as</i> the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness <i>is as</i> iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, he hath also rejected thee from <i>being</i> king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And Samuel said unto him, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, <i>that is</i> better than thou.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he <i>is</i> not a man, that he should repent.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Then he said, I have sinned: <i>yet</i> honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> thy God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> in Gilgal.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
