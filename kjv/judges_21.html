<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.

    <b>5</b> And the children of Israel said, Who <i>is there</i> among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>?

<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.

    <b>8</b> And they said, What one <i>is there</i> of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> For the people were numbered, and, behold, <i>there were</i> none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And this <i>is</i> the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan.

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And the whole congregation sent <i>some</i> to speak to the children of Benjamin that <i>were</i> in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.

    <b>14</b> And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.

    <b>19</b> Then they said, Behold, <i>there is</i> a feast of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> in Shiloh yearly <i>in a place</i> which <i>is</i> on the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.

    <b>21</b> And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.

<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, <i>that</i> ye should be guilty.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And the children of Benjamin did so, and took <i>them</i> wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
