    <b>1</b> Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Grace <i>be</i> to you and peace from God the Father, and <i>from</i> our Lord Jesus Christ,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> To whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> As we said before, so say I now again, If any <i>man</i> preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught <i>it</i>, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called <i>me</i> by his grace,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And they glorified God in me.
