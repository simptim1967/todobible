    <b>3</b> And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead <i>is</i> ours, and we <i>be</i> still, <i>and</i> take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?

<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I <i>am</i> as thou <i>art</i>, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> to day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver <i>it</i> into the hand of the king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And Jehoshaphat said, <i>Is there</i> not here a prophet of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> besides, that we might enquire of him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <i>There is</i> yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten <i>hither</i> Micaiah the son of Imlah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> shall deliver <i>it</i> into the king's hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets <i>declare</i> good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak <i>that which is</i> good.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And Micaiah said, <i>As</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> liveth, what the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> saith unto me, that will I speak.

<div class="verse" id="v15">

<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and said, I will persuade him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade <i>him</i>, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Now therefore, behold, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath spoken evil concerning thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> from me to speak unto thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this <i>fellow</i> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it <i>is</i> the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it <i>was</i> not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And a <i>certain</i> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And <i>one</i> washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> which he spake.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing <i>that which was</i> right in the eyes of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; <i>for</i> the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

    <b>46</b> And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.
