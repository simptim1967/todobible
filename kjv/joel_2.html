    <b>2</b> A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, <i>even</i> to the years of many generations.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land <i>is</i> as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.

    <b>23</b> Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first <i>month</i>.
