    <b>1</b> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left <i>us</i> of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard <i>it</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh <i>day</i> on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And in this <i>place</i> again, If they shall enter into my rest.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:

    <b>7</b> Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God <i>did</i> from his.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> For the word of God <i>is</i> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <i>is</i> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things <i>are</i> naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> profession.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
