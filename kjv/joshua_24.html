    <b>2</b> And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, <i>even</i> Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And when they cried unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.

<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, <i>even</i> the two kings of the Amorites; <i>but</i> not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.

    <b>14</b> Now therefore fear the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.

<div class="verse" id="v15">

    <b>17</b> For the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> our God, he <i>it is</i> that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:

<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: for he <i>is</i> an holy God; he <i>is</i> a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> If ye forsake the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.

    <b>23</b> Now therefore put away, <i>said he</i>, the strange gods which <i>are</i> among you, and incline your heart unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And the people said unto Joshua, The <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.

    <b>25</b> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that <i>was</i> by the sanctuary of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.

<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
