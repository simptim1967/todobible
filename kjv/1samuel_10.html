    <b>1</b> Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured <i>it</i> upon his head, and kissed him, and said, <i>Is it</i> not because the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath anointed thee <i>to be</i> captain over his inheritance?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And they will salute thee, and give thee two <i>loaves</i> of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where <i>is</i> the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And the Spirit of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, <i>that</i> thou do as occasion serve thee; for God <i>is</i> with thee.

<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, <i>and</i> to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And it was <i>so</i>, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> is come unto the son of Kish? <i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And one of the same place answered and said, But who <i>is</i> their father? Therefore it became a proverb, <i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?

    <b>13</b> And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.

    <b>19</b> And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, <i>Nay</i>, but set a king over us.

<div class="verse" id="v20">

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Therefore they enquired of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> further, if the man should yet come thither. And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath chosen, that <i>there is</i> none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote <i>it</i> in a book, and laid <i>it</i> up before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
