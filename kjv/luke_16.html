    <b>1</b> And he said also unto his disciples, <woc>There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> <woc>And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> <woc>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> <woc>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> <woc>So he called every one of his lord's debtors <i>unto him</i>, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> <woc>And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> <woc>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <woc>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> <woc>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> <woc>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> <woc>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <i>riches</i>?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <woc>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> <woc>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> <woc>The law and the prophets <i>were</i> until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</woc>

    <b>19</b> <woc>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> <woc>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> <woc>And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <woc>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <woc>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <woc>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <woc>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that <i>would come</i> from thence.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <woc>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <woc>For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <woc>Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <woc>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> <woc>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</woc>
