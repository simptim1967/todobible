</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.

    <b>5</b> But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
</div>

    <b>6</b> Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
</div>

    <b>7</b> Neither be ye idolaters, as <i>were</i> some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.

    <b>8</b> Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

    <b>9</b> Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.

    <b>13</b> There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God <i>is</i> faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear <i>it</i>.
