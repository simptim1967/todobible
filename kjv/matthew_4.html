    <b>2</b> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.

<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> But he answered and said, <woc>It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in <i>their</i> hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Jesus said unto him, <woc>It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;

    <b>12</b> Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

    <b>19</b> And he saith unto them, <woc>Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.

<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.
