    <b>1</b> And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And she said to the king, <i>It was</i> a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

    <b>6</b> Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen <i>it</i>: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: <i>for</i> thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Happy <i>are</i> thy men, and happy <i>are</i> these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Blessed be the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, <i>to be</i> king for the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span> thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And the king made <i>of</i> the algum trees terraces to the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps;'>Lord</span>, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside <i>that</i> which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.

    <b>13</b> Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that <i>are</i> in the low plains in abundance.
