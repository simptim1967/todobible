</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And she said to the king, <i>It was</i> a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

    <b>7</b> Happy <i>are</i> thy men, and happy <i>are</i> these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And the king made <i>of</i> the algum trees terraces to the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside <i>that</i> which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;
