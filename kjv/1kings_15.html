    <b>1</b> Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name <i>was</i> Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> his God, as the heart of David his father.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Nevertheless for David's sake did the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Because David did <i>that which was</i> right in the eyes of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and turned not aside from any <i>thing</i> that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name <i>was</i> Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Asa did <i>that which was</i> right in the eyes of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, as <i>did</i> David his father.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from <i>being</i> queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt <i>it</i> by the brook Kidron.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> all his days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, silver, and gold, and vessels.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Then Asa took all the silver and the gold <i>that were</i> left in the treasures of the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <i>There is</i> a league between me and thee, <i>and</i> between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> So Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And it came to pass, when Baasha heard <i>thereof</i>, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none <i>was</i> exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And he did evil in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which <i>belonged</i> to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And it came to pass, when he reigned, <i>that</i> he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel to anger.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And he did evil in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
