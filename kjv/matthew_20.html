    <b>1</b> <woc>For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <i>that is</i> an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> <woc>And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> <woc>And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> <woc>And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> <woc>Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> <woc>And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> <woc>They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, <i>that</i> shall ye receive.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <woc>So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them <i>their</i> hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> <woc>And when they came that <i>were hired</i> about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> <woc>But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> <woc>And when they had received <i>it</i>, they murmured against the goodman of the house,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> <woc>Saying, These last have wrought <i>but</i> one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> <woc>But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> <woc>Take <i>that</i> thine <i>is</i>, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> <woc>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> <woc>So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <woc>And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify <i>him</i>: and the third day he shall rise again.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping <i>him</i>, and desiring a certain thing of him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And he said unto her, <woc>What wilt thou?</woc> She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> But Jesus answered and said, <woc>Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</woc> They say unto him, We are able.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And he saith unto them, <woc>Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but <i>it shall be given to them</i> for whom it is prepared of my Father.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And when the ten heard <i>it</i>, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> But Jesus called them <i>unto him</i>, and said, <woc>Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <woc>And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <woc>Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, <i>thou</i> Son of David.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, <woc>What will ye that I shall do unto you?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> So Jesus had compassion <i>on them</i>, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
