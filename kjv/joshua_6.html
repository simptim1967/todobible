    <b>5</b> And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long <i>blast</i> with the ram's horn, <i>and</i> when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.

    <b>6</b> And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.

    <b>8</b> And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> followed them.

    <b>10</b> And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall <i>any</i> word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> So the ark of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> compassed the city, going about <i>it</i> once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

    <b>16</b> And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> hath given you the city.

    <b>20</b> So the people shouted when <i>the priests</i> blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And they utterly destroyed all that <i>was</i> in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.

<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

    <b>23</b> And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And they burnt the city with fire, and all that <i>was</i> therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel <i>even</i> unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And Joshua adjured <i>them</i> at that time, saying, Cursed <i>be</i> the man before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest <i>son</i> shall he set up the gates of it.
