    <b>1</b> Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Therefore David enquired of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Then David enquired of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> yet again. And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, <i>that</i> he came down <i>with</i> an ephod in his hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Then said David, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said, He will come down.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said, They will deliver <i>thee</i> up.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Then David and his men, <i>which were</i> about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David <i>was</i> in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And they two made a covenant before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which <i>is</i> on the south of Jeshimon?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part <i>shall be</i> to deliver him into the king's hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And Saul said, Blessed <i>be</i> ye of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; for ye have compassion on me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, <i>and</i> who hath seen him there: for it is told me <i>that</i> he dealeth very subtilly.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men <i>were</i> in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Saul also and his men went to seek <i>him</i>. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard <i>that</i>, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.
