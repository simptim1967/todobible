    <b>1</b> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the <i>other</i> kine upon the brink of the river.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, <i>it was</i> a dream.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but <i>there was</i> none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, <i>both</i> me and the chief baker:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And <i>there was</i> there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved <i>himself</i>, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and <i>there is</i> none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, <i>that</i> thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, <i>It is</i> not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they <i>were</i> still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, <i>and</i> blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told <i>this</i> unto the magicians; but <i>there was</i> none that could declare <i>it</i> to me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh <i>is</i> one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he <i>is</i> about to do.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> The seven good kine <i>are</i> seven years; and the seven good ears <i>are</i> seven years: the dream <i>is</i> one.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them <i>are</i> seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> This <i>is</i> the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God <i>is</i> about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it <i>shall be</i> very grievous.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; <i>it is</i> because the thing <i>is</i> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Let Pharaoh do <i>this</i>, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find <i>such a one</i> as this <i>is</i>, a man in whom the Spirit of God <i>is</i>?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, <i>there is</i> none so discreet and wise as thou <i>art</i>:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him <i>ruler</i> over all the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I <i>am</i> Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over <i>all</i> the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And Joseph <i>was</i> thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which <i>was</i> round about every city, laid he up in the same.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for <i>it was</i> without number.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, <i>said he</i>, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v54">
    <b>54</b> And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v55">
    <b>55</b> And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v56">
    <b>56</b> And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v57">
    <b>57</b> And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy <i>corn</i>; because that the famine was <i>so</i> sore in all lands.
