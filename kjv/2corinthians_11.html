    <b>1</b> Would to God ye could bear with me a little in <i>my</i> folly: and indeed bear with me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <i>you as</i> a chaste virgin to Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or <i>if</i> ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with <i>him</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> But though <i>I be</i> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> I robbed other churches, taking wages <i>of them</i>, to do you service.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all <i>things</i> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <i>so</i> will I keep <i>myself</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> For such <i>are</i> false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Therefore <i>it is</i> no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> That which I speak, I speak <i>it</i> not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye <i>yourselves</i> are wise.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour <i>you</i>, if a man take <i>of you</i>, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Are they Hebrews? so <i>am</i> I. Are they Israelites? so <i>am</i> I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so <i>am</i> I.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I <i>am</i> more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> Of the Jews five times received I forty <i>stripes</i> save one.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <i>In</i> journeyings often, <i>in</i> perils of waters, <i>in</i> perils of robbers, <i>in</i> perils by <i>mine own</i> countrymen, <i>in</i> perils by the heathen, <i>in</i> perils in the city, <i>in</i> perils in the wilderness, <i>in</i> perils in the sea, <i>in</i> perils among false brethren;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
