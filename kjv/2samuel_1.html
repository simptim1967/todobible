    <b>1</b> Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and <i>so</i> it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here <i>am</i> I.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And he said unto me, Who <i>art</i> thou? And I answered him, I <i>am</i> an Amalekite.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life <i>is</i> yet whole in me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that <i>was</i> upon his head, and the bracelet that <i>was</i> on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that <i>were</i> with him:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence <i>art</i> thou? And he answered, I <i>am</i> the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>'s anointed?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, <i>and</i> fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And David said unto him, Thy blood <i>be</i> upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>'s anointed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah <i>the use of</i> the bow: behold, <i>it is</i> written in the book of Jasher.)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Tell <i>it</i> not in Gath, publish <i>it</i> not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Ye mountains of Gilboa, <i>let there be</i> no dew, neither <i>let there be</i> rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, <i>as though he had</i> not <i>been</i> anointed with oil.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Saul and Jonathan <i>were</i> lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with <i>other</i> delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, <i>thou wast</i> slain in thine high places.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
