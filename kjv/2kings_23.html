</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.

    <b>21</b> And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> your God, as <i>it is</i> written in the book of this covenant.

<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> Notwithstanding the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.
