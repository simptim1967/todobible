<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
