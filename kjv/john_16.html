<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> <woc>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, <i>that</i> shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> <woc>He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew <i>it</i> unto you.</woc>

    <b>17</b> Then said <i>some</i> of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, <woc>A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</woc>

    <b>21</b> <woc>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <woc>And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <woc>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give <i>it</i> you.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <woc>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <woc>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <woc>For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <woc>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.

<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Jesus answered them, <woc>Do ye now believe?</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v33">
