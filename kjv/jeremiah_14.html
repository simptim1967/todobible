<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.

    <b>16</b> And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
