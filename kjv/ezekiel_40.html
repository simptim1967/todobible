</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which <i>was</i> as the frame of a city on the south.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And he brought me thither, and, behold, <i>there was</i> a man, whose appearance <i>was</i> like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew <i>them</i> unto thee <i>art</i> thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.

<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits <i>long</i> by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, <i>which was</i> one reed broad; and the other threshold <i>of the gate, which was</i> one reed broad.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And <i>every</i> little chamber <i>was</i> one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers <i>were</i> five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within <i>was</i> one reed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate <i>was</i> inward.

<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the little chambers of the gate eastward <i>were</i> three on this side, and three on that side; they three <i>were</i> of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.

<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; <i>and</i> the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> He measured then the gate from the roof of <i>one</i> little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth <i>was</i> five and twenty cubits, door against door.

<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.

<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, <i>there were</i> chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers <i>were</i> upon the pavement.

    <b>18</b> And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates <i>was</i> the lower pavement.

<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And the gate of the inner court <i>was</i> over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.

    <b>24</b> After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.

    <b>26</b> And <i>there were</i> seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof <i>were</i> before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.

<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And <i>there was</i> a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.

<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And in the porch of the gate <i>were</i> two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.

<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, <i>were</i> two tables; and on the other side, which <i>was</i> at the porch of the gate, <i>were</i> two tables.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> Four tables <i>were</i> on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew <i>their sacrifices</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And the four tables <i>were</i> of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And within <i>were</i> hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables <i>was</i> the flesh of the offering.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And without the inner gate <i>were</i> the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which <i>was</i> at the side of the north gate; and their prospect <i>was</i> toward the south: one at the side of the east gate <i>having</i> the prospect toward the north.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the south, <i>is</i> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And the chamber whose prospect <i>is</i> toward the north <i>is</i> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these <i>are</i> the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> to minister unto him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar <i>that was</i> before the house.

<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured <i>each</i> post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate <i>was</i> three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> The length of the porch <i>was</i> twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and <i>he brought me</i> by the steps whereby they went up to it: and <i>there were</i> pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
