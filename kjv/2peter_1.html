    <b>1</b> Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that <i>pertain</i> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> For if these things be in you, and abound, they make <i>you that ye shall</i> neither <i>be</i> barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know <i>them</i>, and be established in the present truth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting <i>you</i> in remembrance;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Knowing that shortly I must put off <i>this</i> my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <i>as they were</i> moved by the Holy Ghost.
