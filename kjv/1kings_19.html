    <b>3</b> And when he saw <i>that</i>, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which <i>belongeth</i> to Judah, and left his servant there.

    <b>4</b> But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, take away my life; for I <i>am</i> not better than my fathers.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise <i>and</i> eat.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And he said, I have been very jealous for the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, <i>even</i> I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.

<div class="verse" id="v11">

    <b>15</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael <i>to be</i> king over Syria:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint <i>to be</i> king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint <i>to be</i> prophet in thy room.

    <b>19</b> So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who <i>was</i> plowing <i>with</i> twelve yoke <i>of oxen</i> before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and <i>then</i> I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
