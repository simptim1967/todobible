    <b>1</b> After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he <i>himself</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <i>sons</i> of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Then Jesus saith unto them, <woc>Children, have ye any meat?</woc> They answered him, No.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.</woc> They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt <i>his</i> fisher's coat <i>unto him</i>, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Jesus saith unto them, <woc>Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Jesus saith unto them, <woc>Come <i>and</i> dine.</woc> And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, <woc>Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?</woc> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <woc>Feed my lambs.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> He saith to him again the second time, <woc>Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</woc> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <woc>Feed my sheep.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> He saith unto him the third time, <woc>Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</woc> Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, <woc>Lovest thou me?</woc> And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, <woc>Feed my sheep.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry <i>thee</i> whither thou wouldest not.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, <woc>Follow me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what <i>shall</i> this man <i>do</i>?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Jesus saith unto him, <woc>If I will that he tarry till I come, what <i>is that</i> to thee? follow thou me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, <woc>If I will that he tarry till I come, what <i>is that</i> to thee?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
