    <b>1</b> In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And he did <i>that which was</i> evil in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as <i>he had done</i> year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor <i>by</i> the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> For <i>so</i> it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And the children of Israel did secretly <i>those</i> things that <i>were</i> not right against the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as <i>did</i> the heathen whom the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> to anger:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> For they served idols, whereof the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Yet the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, <i>and by</i> all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments <i>and</i> my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> their God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that <i>were</i> round about them, <i>concerning</i> whom the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had charged them, that they should not do like them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And they left all the commandments of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> their God, and made them molten images, <i>even</i> two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, to provoke him to anger.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Therefore the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Also Judah kept not the commandments of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and made them sin a great sin.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Until the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And the king of Assyria brought <i>men</i> from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed <i>them</i> in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And <i>so</i> it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, <i>that</i> they feared not the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>: therefore the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> sent lions among them, which slew <i>some</i> of them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put <i>them</i> in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> So they feared the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> They feared the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> With whom the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> But the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> But the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> So these nations feared the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.
