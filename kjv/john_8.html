    <b>1</b> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <i>his</i> finger wrote on the ground, <i>as though he heard them not</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, <woc>He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And they which heard <i>it</i>, being convicted by <i>their own</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <i>even</i> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, <woc>Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, <woc>Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, <woc>I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Jesus answered and said unto them, <woc>Though I bear record of myself, <i>yet</i> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> <woc>Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> <woc>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> <woc>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, <woc>Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Then said Jesus again unto them, <woc>I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <woc>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am <i>he</i>, ye shall die in your sins.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, <woc>Even <i>the same</i> that I said unto you from the beginning.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Then said Jesus unto them, <woc>When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <i>he</i>, and <i>that</i> I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <woc>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> As he spake these words, many believed on him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, <woc>If ye continue in my word, <i>then</i> are ye my disciples indeed;</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <woc>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, <woc>Ye shall be made free?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Jesus answered them, <woc>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> <woc>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <i>but</i> the Son abideth ever.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> <woc>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> <woc>I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> <woc>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, <woc>If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> <woc>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> <woc>Ye do the deeds of your father.</woc> Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <i>even</i> God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> Jesus said unto them, <woc>If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> <woc>Why do ye not understand my speech? <i>even</i> because ye cannot hear my word.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> <woc>Ye are of <i>your</i> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> <woc>And because I tell <i>you</i> the truth, ye believe me not.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> <woc>Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> <woc>He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear <i>them</i> not, because ye are not of God.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> Jesus answered, <woc>I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> <woc>And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> <woc>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, <woc>If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v54">
    <b>54</b> Jesus answered, <woc>If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v55">
    <b>55</b> <woc>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v56">
    <b>56</b> <woc>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw <i>it</i>, and was glad.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v57">
    <b>57</b> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v58">
    <b>58</b> Jesus said unto them, <woc>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v59">
    <b>59</b> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
