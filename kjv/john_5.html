    <b>1</b> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <i>market</i> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time <i>in that case</i>, he saith unto him, <span style="color:red;">Wilt thou be made whole?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> Jesus saith unto him, <span style="color:red;">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry <i>thy</i> bed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, <span style="color:red;">Take up thy bed, and walk.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, <span style="color:red;">Take up thy bed, and walk?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in <i>that</i> place.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> But Jesus answered them, <span style="color:red;">My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Then answered Jesus and said unto them, <span style="color:red;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> <span style="color:red;">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> <span style="color:red;">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth <i>them</i>; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <span style="color:red;">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <span style="color:red;">That all <i>men</i> should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <span style="color:red;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> <span style="color:red;">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <span style="color:red;">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> <span style="color:red;">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> <span style="color:red;">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <span style="color:red;">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <span style="color:red;">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> <span style="color:red;">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> <span style="color:red;">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> <span style="color:red;">Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> <span style="color:red;">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> <span style="color:red;">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> <span style="color:red;">But I have greater witness than <i>that</i> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> <span style="color:red;">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> <span style="color:red;">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> <span style="color:red;">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> <span style="color:red;">And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> <span style="color:red;">I receive not honour from men.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> <span style="color:red;">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> <span style="color:red;">I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> <span style="color:red;">How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that <i>cometh</i> from God only?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> <span style="color:red;">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is <i>one</i> that accuseth you, <i>even</i> Moses, in whom ye trust.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> <span style="color:red;">For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> <span style="color:red;">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</span>
