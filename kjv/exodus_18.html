</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">

    <b>3</b> And her two sons; of which the name of the one <i>was</i> Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And the name of the other <i>was</i> Eliezer; for the God of my father, <i>said he, was</i> mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:
</div>

    <b>6</b> And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of <i>their</i> welfare; and they came into the tent.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And Moses told his father in law all that the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, <i>and</i> all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and <i>how</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> delivered them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And Jethro said, Blessed <i>be</i> the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Now I know that the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> <i>is</i> greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly <i>he was</i> above them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What <i>is</i> this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make <i>them</i> know the statutes of God, and his laws.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest <i>is</i> not good.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that <i>is</i> with thee: for this thing <i>is</i> too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place <i>such</i> over them, <i>to be</i> rulers of thousands, <i>and</i> rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, <i>that</i> every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear <i>the burden</i> with thee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee <i>so</i>, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
