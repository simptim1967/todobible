    <b>21</b> <woc>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</woc>

    <b>22</b> <woc>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</woc>

    <b>27</b> <woc>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v28">

<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <woc>And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast <i>it</i> from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not <i>that</i> thy whole body should be cast into hell.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <woc>And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast <i>it</i> from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not <i>that</i> thy whole body should be cast into hell.</woc>

<div class="verse" id="v44">

    <b>45</b> <woc>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</woc>
