    <b>1</b> If <i>there be</i> therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, <i>being</i> of one accord, of one mind.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> <i>Let</i> nothing <i>be done</i> through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <i>things</i> in heaven, and <i>things</i> in earth, and <i>things</i> under the earth;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And <i>that</i> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ <i>is</i> Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of <i>his</i> good pleasure.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
