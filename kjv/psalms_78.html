    <b>1</b> Give ear, O my people, <i>to</i> my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> We will not hide <i>them</i> from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> That the generation to come might know <i>them, even</i> the children <i>which</i> should be born; <i>who</i> should arise and declare <i>them</i> to their children:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation <i>that</i> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> The children of Ephraim, <i>being</i> armed, <i>and</i> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, <i>in</i> the field of Zoan.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave <i>them</i> drink as <i>out of</i> the great depths.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Therefore the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> heard <i>this</i>, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And he let <i>it</i> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat <i>was</i> yet in their mouths,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen <i>men</i> of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And they remembered that God <i>was</i> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> But he, <i>being</i> full of compassion, forgave <i>their</i> iniquity, and destroyed <i>them</i> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> For he remembered that they <i>were but</i> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <i>and</i> grieve him in the desert!
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> They remembered not his hand, <i>nor</i> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <i>among them</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <i>their</i> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v54">
    <b>54</b> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <i>even to</i> this mountain, <i>which</i> his right hand had purchased.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v55">
    <b>55</b> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v56">
    <b>56</b> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v57">
    <b>57</b> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v58">
    <b>58</b> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v59">
    <b>59</b> When God heard <i>this</i>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v60">
    <b>60</b> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent <i>which</i> he placed among men;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v61">
    <b>61</b> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v62">
    <b>62</b> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v63">
    <b>63</b> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v64">
    <b>64</b> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v65">
    <b>65</b> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <i>and</i> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v66">
    <b>66</b> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v67">
    <b>67</b> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v68">
    <b>68</b> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v69">
    <b>69</b> And he built his sanctuary like high <i>palaces</i>, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v70">
    <b>70</b> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v71">
    <b>71</b> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v72">
    <b>72</b> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
