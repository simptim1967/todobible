    <b>1</b> Now upon the first <i>day</i> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain <i>others</i> with them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And as they were afraid, and bowed down <i>their</i> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> Saying, <woc>The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And they remembered his words,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <i>the mother</i> of James, and other <i>women that were</i> with them, which told these things unto the apostles.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem <i>about</i> threescore furlongs.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And it came to pass, that, while they communed <i>together</i> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And he said unto them, <woc>What manner of communications <i>are</i> these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And he said unto them, <woc>What things?</woc> And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found <i>it</i> even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Then he said unto them, <woc>O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> <woc>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed <i>it</i>, and brake, and gave to them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And they told what things <i>were done</i> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, <woc>Peace <i>be</i> unto you.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And he said unto them, <woc>Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> <woc>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them <i>his</i> hands and <i>his</i> feet.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, <woc>Have ye here any meat?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And he took <i>it</i>, and did eat before them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And he said unto them, <woc>These <i>are</i> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <i>in</i> the prophets, and <i>in</i> the psalms, concerning me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And said unto them, <woc>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> <woc>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> <woc>And ye are witnesses of these things.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> <woc>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
