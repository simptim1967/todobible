<div class="verse" id="v9">

    <b>13</b> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit <i>it</i> for ever.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.

<div class="verse" id="v24">

    <b>25</b> And when Moses saw that the people <i>were</i> naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto <i>their</i> shame among their enemies:)

    <b>26</b> Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who <i>is</i> on the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>'s side? <i>let him come</i> unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">

<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And Moses returned unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

    <b>32</b> Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin&ndash;; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
