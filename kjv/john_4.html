    <b>1</b> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And he must needs go through Samaria.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with <i>his</i> journey, sat thus on the well: <i>and</i> it was about the sixth hour.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, <woc>Give me to drink.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> Jesus answered and said unto her, <woc>If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Jesus answered and said unto her, <woc>Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> <woc>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Jesus saith unto her, <woc>Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, <woc>Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Jesus saith unto her, <woc>Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <woc>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <woc>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <woc>God <i>is</i> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship <i>him</i> in spirit and in truth.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> Jesus saith unto her, <woc>I that speak unto thee am <i>he</i>.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> But he said unto them, <woc>I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <i>ought</i> to eat?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Jesus saith unto them, <woc>My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> <woc>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <i>then</i> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> <woc>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> <woc>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> <woc>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And many more believed because of his own word;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard <i>him</i> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> Then said Jesus unto him, <woc>Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> Jesus saith unto him, <woc>Go thy way; thy son liveth.</woc> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told <i>him</i>, saying, Thy son liveth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> So the father knew that <i>it was</i> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, <woc>Thy son liveth:</woc> and himself believed, and his whole house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v54">
    <b>54</b> This <i>is</i> again the second miracle <i>that</i> Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
