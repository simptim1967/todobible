<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <i>be</i> with you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">

</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye <i>so</i> ill with me, <i>as</i> to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, <i>Is</i> your father yet alive? have ye <i>another</i> brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, <i>and</i> also our little ones.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And their father Israel said unto them, If <i>it must be</i> so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry <i>it</i> again in your hand; peradventure it <i>was</i> an oversight:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved <i>of my children</i>, I am bereaved.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring <i>these</i> men home, and slay, and make ready; for <i>these</i> men shall dine with me at noon.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,

    <b>20</b> And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, <i>every</i> man's money <i>was</i> in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And he said, Peace <i>be</i> to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave <i>them</i> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which <i>was</i> in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And he asked them of <i>their</i> welfare, and said, <i>Is</i> your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? <i>Is</i> he yet alive?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And they answered, Thy servant our father <i>is</i> in good health, he <i>is</i> yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, <i>Is</i> this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought <i>where</i> to weep; and he entered into <i>his</i> chamber, and wept there.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that <i>is</i> an abomination unto the Egyptians.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> And he took <i>and sent</i> messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
