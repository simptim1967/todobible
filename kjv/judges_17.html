    <b>3</b> And when he had restored the eleven hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.

<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

    <b>10</b> And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten <i>shekels</i> of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
