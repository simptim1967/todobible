<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, <i>it is</i> even in my sack: and their heart failed <i>them</i>, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> God hath done unto us?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

    <b>30</b> The man, <i>who is</i> the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.

<div class="verse" id="v34">

<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money <i>was</i> in his sack: and when <i>both</i> they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved <i>of my children</i>: Joseph <i>is</i> not, and Simeon <i>is</i> not, and ye will take Benjamin <i>away</i>: all these things are against me.

<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
