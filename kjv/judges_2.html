<div class="verse" id="v5">

<div class="verse" id="v11">

<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was against them for evil, as the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had said, and as the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.

    <b>18</b> And when the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> raised them up judges, then the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.

<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, <i>that</i> they returned, and corrupted <i>themselves</i> more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.

<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And the anger of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;

    <b>21</b> I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
