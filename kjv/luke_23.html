    <b>1</b> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this <i>fellow</i> perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, <span style="color:red;">Thou sayest <i>it</i>.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and <i>to</i> the people, I find no fault in this man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long <i>season</i>, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked <i>him</i>, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <i>him</i> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> I will therefore chastise him, and release <i>him</i>.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this <i>man</i>, and release unto us Barabbas:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> But they cried, saying, Crucify <i>him</i>, crucify him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let <i>him</i> go.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <i>it</i> after Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> But Jesus turning unto them said, <span style="color:red;">Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <span style="color:red;">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <i>are</i> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> <span style="color:red;">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> <span style="color:red;">For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> Then said Jesus, <span style="color:red;">Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</span> And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided <i>him</i>, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> And Jesus said unto him, <span style="color:red;">Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</span>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, <span style="color:red;">Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit:</span> and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> And, behold, <i>there was</i> a man named Joseph, a counsellor; <i>and he was</i> a good man, and a just:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) <i>he was</i> of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> This <i>man</i> went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v54">
    <b>54</b> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v55">
    <b>55</b> And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v56">
    <b>56</b> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
