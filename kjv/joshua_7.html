    <b>1</b> But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> was kindled against the children of Israel.

    <b>2</b> And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which <i>is</i> beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.

<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; <i>and</i> make not all the people to labour thither; for they <i>are but</i> few.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">

<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>God</span>, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!

    <b>10</b> And the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?

    <b>11</b> Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put <i>it</i> even among their own stuff.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, <i>but</i> turned <i>their</i> backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.

<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel, <i>There is</i> an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, <i>that</i> the tribe which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> taketh shall come according to the families <i>thereof</i>; and the family which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> shall take shall come by households; and the household which the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> shall take shall come man by man.

    <b>16</b> So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

    <b>19</b> And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide <i>it</i> not from me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they <i>are</i> hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, <i>it was</i> hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.

<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span> turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.
