    <b>9</b> And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.

<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought <i>it</i> to him.

<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lord</span>. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.
