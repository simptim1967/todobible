    <b>2</b> (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> I am verily a man <i>which am</i> a Jew, born in Tarsus, <i>a city</i> in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, <i>and</i> taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, <woc>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, <woc>I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, <woc>Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt <i>there</i>,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> And saw him saying unto me, <woc>Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.

<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> And he said unto me, <woc>Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> And they gave him audience unto this word, and <i>then</i> lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a <i>fellow</i> from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> And as they cried out, and cast off <i>their</i> clothes, and threw dust into the air,
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> When the centurion heard <i>that</i>, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was <i>free</i> born.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from <i>his</i> bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
