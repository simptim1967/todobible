    <b>1</b> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v2">
    <b>2</b> Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v3">
    <b>3</b> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v4">
    <b>4</b> For <i>there is</i> no man <i>that</i> doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v5">
    <b>5</b> For neither did his brethren believe in him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v6">
    <b>6</b> Then Jesus said unto them, <woc>My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v7">
    <b>7</b> <woc>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v8">
    <b>8</b> <woc>Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v9">
    <b>9</b> When he had said these words unto them, he abode <i>still</i> in Galilee.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v10">
    <b>10</b> But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v11">
    <b>11</b> Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v12">
    <b>12</b> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v13">
    <b>13</b> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v14">
    <b>14</b> Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v15">
    <b>15</b> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v16">
    <b>16</b> Jesus answered them, and said, <woc>My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v17">
    <b>17</b> <woc>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <i>whether</i> I speak of myself.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v18">
    <b>18</b> <woc>He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v19">
    <b>19</b> <woc>Did not Moses give you the law, and <i>yet</i> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v20">
    <b>20</b> The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v21">
    <b>21</b> Jesus answered and said unto them, <woc>I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v22">
    <b>22</b> <woc>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v23">
    <b>23</b> <woc>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v24">
    <b>24</b> <woc>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v25">
    <b>25</b> Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v26">
    <b>26</b> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v27">
    <b>27</b> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v28">
    <b>28</b> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, <woc>Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v29">
    <b>29</b> <woc>But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v30">
    <b>30</b> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v31">
    <b>31</b> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this <i>man</i> hath done?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v32">
    <b>32</b> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v33">
    <b>33</b> Then said Jesus unto them, <woc>Yet a little while am I with you, and <i>then</i> I go unto him that sent me.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v34">
    <b>34</b> <woc>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me</i>: and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v35">
    <b>35</b> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v36">
    <b>36</b> What <i>manner of</i> saying is this that he said, <woc>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me</i>: and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come?</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v37">
    <b>37</b> In the last day, that great <i>day</i> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, <woc>If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v38">
    <b>38</b> <woc>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</woc>
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v39">
    <b>39</b> (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet <i>given</i>; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v40">
    <b>40</b> Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v41">
    <b>41</b> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v42">
    <b>42</b> Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v43">
    <b>43</b> So there was a division among the people because of him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v44">
    <b>44</b> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v45">
    <b>45</b> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v46">
    <b>46</b> The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v47">
    <b>47</b> Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v48">
    <b>48</b> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v49">
    <b>49</b> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v50">
    <b>50</b> Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v51">
    <b>51</b> Doth our law judge <i>any</i> man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v52">
    <b>52</b> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
</div>
<div class="verse" id="v53">
    <b>53</b> And every man went unto his own house.
