    <h1>Live With Purpose</h1>
    <hr>
		
    <p>Be encouraged. God has a purpose for your life.</p> 

	<h2>You Were No Accident Of Birth</h2>
	
    <p>You were not an accident of birth or born by chance. 
	You were fearfully and wonderfully made in secret by God.
	Your members were designed and documented by Him before ever you were formed in the womb.</p>
	
	<p>You were born for this precise time!</p>
	
	<h2>You Are Not A Loser</h2>
	
    <p>You are not a loser. Nor does your past make you a failure. Stop beating yourself up.</p>
	
	<p>God made you in His own image. He loves you unconditionally for exactly who you are 
	regardless of anything you have done. God does not make mistakes!</p>
	
	<h2>God Thinks About You</h2>
	
	<p>God has never stopped thinking about you. His precious thoughts for you are inumerable. If
	you were to count them they would be greater in number than the grains of sand on a beach.</p>
	
	<h2>God Has A Plan For You</h2>
	
	<p>God has always had a plan for your life from the very beginning (see 
    <a href="kjv/jeremiah_29.html#v11">Jeremiah 29:11</a>).</p>

    <h2>Jesus Can Wash You Clean And Set You Free</h2>
	
	<p>Jesus died to wash you clean. When you are washed with the blood of the lamb, all guilt and shame
	is washed away and forgotten. God wants you to focus on your future, not your past. He is prepared
	to completely forgive and forget your past sins.</p>
		
    <h2>One Life</h2>

    <p>We each have one life. This life counts. It is not a dress rehearsal.</p>
	
	<p>Will you spend your life watching other peoples' lives and forget to live your own?</p>
	
	<p>God created you to have your own life, your own adventure.</p>
	
	<p>Stop spectating and start living. Don't settle for the mundane or mediocre. 
	Aim for extraordinary!</p>

    <h2>God Wants Relationship With You</h2>

	<p>The Christian life is a relationship with God. Relationships work by spending time together 
	in conversation. Conversations work when two people are both listening and speaking.</p>
	
	<p>For our relationship to work well with God we have to have continually hearing ears to hear what
	He is saying. It's not good enough to know what He has said but rather we must hear what He is saying
	right now.</p>
	
	<p>God is looking for individuals. He is looking down on the children of men to see if there 
	are any who have understanding, to see if there are any who seek God (see Psalm 53:2).</p>
	
	<p>God desires and always intended this thing we call "Christianity" to be a living, dynamic 
	relationship with you every single day. Not out of duty but out of delight and love for Him.</p>
	
	<p>There is never a day when God doesn't want to speak to you. There is not a moment when He 
	is not speaking or a moment when He is too busy to speak with you because He is dealing with
	somebody else!</p>
	
	<p>Today He has new things He wants to say to you. 
	Today He wants to reveal new measures of His love to you. 
	He wants to impact your emotions, impact your heart. He wants to come close to you.</p>
	
	<p>But we are creatures of habit and we easily turn off. We are easily distracted and
	slip back into our routines. The suddenly we awaken and we say "God are you still there?
	Are you saying anything to me?" And then we feel the warmth of His presence come again
	and we settle down again. But He wants us to stay close all the time.</p>
	
	<h2>God Wants To Spend Time With You</h2>
	
	<p>Your quiet time with God is not just about your own spiritual growth. People who love
	each other willingly spend time together. It gives God pleasure to spend time with you.
	He redeemed you at great cost and wants to have fellowship with you. Don't deny Him that
	after all that He has done for you.</p>
	
    <h2>Bring Purpose To Your Life</h2>

    <p>Establishing a relationship with God through prayer and by reading the bible will help 
    you to discover exactly what your unique purpose is and to live out your divine mandate 
	abundantly to God's glory.</p>

    <p>Don't be discouraged if it takes a while to discover your purpose.
    Just keep yourself busy working and wait patiently and faithfully upon God to reveal it 
	to you.</p>

    <h2>God Wants To Speak Specifically To You</h2>

    <p>God has always been a speaking God. God wants to speak to everybody!</p>

    <p>Whilst God will speak to you through the bible, this is only a general conversation which 
	is applicable to all. It won't answer the very specific and unique questions about your life.</p>

    <p>However, God wants to speak specifically into your life. To do this God gives the indwelling
	Holy Spirit to believers to work with your spirit to communicate with you. The Holy Spirit knows 
	the mind and will of God and only speaks what He hears. The Holy Spirit will lead you into all 
	truth.</p>

    <p>God speaks to us in order for us to take the right direction and avoid pitfalls. Most 
	importantly, God speaks to us for our good.</p>

    <p>When you were born again, you entered into a relationship with the Holy Spirit who now 
	indwells you.</p>

    <p>Receiving direction from God is crucial to your success in life. The Lord wants to teach you 
    and lead you in the direction that you should go (see Isa 48:17).</p>

    <p>Do not underestimate the power of the ministry that God has given you. You are needed in the kingdom!
    You may never know the significance of the part you played in this life until everything is revealed 
    in heaven.</p>
