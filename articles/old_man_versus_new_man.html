<h1>Old Man versus New Man: The Christian Timeline</h1>
<hr>

<p>Ever wondered how becoming a Christian might change your life?<br>
In what ways might you be changed?<br>
What exactly can you expect?<br>
How exactly do these changes come about?</p>

<p>In this timeline journey of the Christian life we look at the 
events along the way and compare the "old man" with the "new man"
so that you can see what to expect and praise God for what he has
done, is doing and will do for you.</p> 

!!! before we were even born
!!! knitted in the womb
!!! born
!!! worldly
!!! sin
self

conversion/born again
babe -> child -> young man -> strong -> father

When we are saved, we have just entered the path that leads to righteousness.
We have the imputed righteousness of Jesus. 
We are justified by faith.
However, we are still carnal in many ways and need to grow spiritually.
We grow spiritually in the Lord through His grace as we gain knowledge, understanding and wisdom 
as we are instructed in His Word and begin to live out our faith. 
We must apply the instructions that we have learned (and receive) to practical living to become that full Christian.

child of light/no longer in darkness
In Scripture, light and darkness are very familiar symbols. 
Intellectually, “light” refers to biblical truth while “darkness” refers to error or falsehood. 
Morally, “light” refers to holiness or purity while “darkness” refers to sin or wrongdoing.
Notice, in this, that God is not a Light. He is Light. 
He is the source of all Light. Light does away with darkness. 
There is no darkness at all where there is God. Light destroys darkness.

old=impatient; new=patient
The natural response to adversity is to escape it. But God uses trouble to mature His people.
When we pray, we usually want to see an instant answer to our prayer. 
We are not instantly transformed into that perfect Christian that we all desire to be, 
and our prayers are many times not answered immediately either. 
There is a growing process to become the person we want to be.
The Bible says that we must be fed milk and honey, until we grow into the mature Christian 
who can handle the meat of the Word. We will see the victory, if we patiently wait for it.

2 Peter 2:10 - walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. 
Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. 

children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, 
by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive

But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ

walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind
Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, 
because of the blindness of their heart: 
Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. 
<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>We are a not-for-profit organisation based in the United Kingdom that simply wants to raise 
the world-wide banner that "Jesus Christ is Lord."</p>

<p>We believe that God's Holy Bible is not just something you read, it's very much 
something you live, breath and do by God's grace for His glory.</p>

<p>We want Jesus to be at the centre of everything we do.</p>

<p>We seek to glorify God and to help others to do so by knowing Jesus, imitating 
Jesus, serving Jesus and sharing Jesus to make Him known.</p>

<h2>Our Intentions</h2>

<p>We hope that the content presented on this website might be an inspiration to all those 
seeking to follow Jesus for God's glory.</p>

<p>We want to help you make the bible part of your everyday living - both in word and deed.</p>

<div class="quoteverse">
<p align="left"><b>8</b>  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>
<b>9</b>  Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
<b>10</b>  For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</p>
<a href="kjv/ephesians_2.html#v8">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>
</div>
 
<p>The ToDo list items and topics are not presented as a legalistic list of Christian "do's and don'ts." 
Neither are they intended to promote justification by works.</p>

<p>The ToDo list seeks to offer readers a chance to learn and be challenged by the scriptures in practical ways 
so that they might increase in the knowledge of God and go on
to demonstrate good works and obedience as a result of their faith.</p>

<p>Often the ToDo items and topics point to spiritual disciplines that may help the reader to 
deepen and strengthen their relationship with God. 
Others serve as faithful warnings, friendly encouragements and
reminders of what the bible tells us to do.</p>

<p>Why not make your bible your ToDo list? Read it. Believe it. Do it! All for God's glory.</p>

<h2>Our Reliance On Jesus</h2>

<p>We acknowledge first and foremost that without Jesus we can do nothing.
We rely on Him and His grace for all that we do.</p>

<div class="quotebox">
<p>Jesus said:</p>
<!--suppress HtmlUnknownTag, HtmlUnknownTag -->
    <woc>&ldquo;without me ye can do nothing&rdquo;</woc>
<a href="kjv/john_15.html#v5">John 15:5</a>
</div>

<p>We must say to all readers from the outset: don't "try" to keep Jesus' commandments 
and instructions in your own intrinsic "power", for you are powerless to carry them out.</p>
 
<p>These are "impossible" standards for fleshly men, but are imminently possible for those 
who learn to surrender to and engage their indwelling omnipotent helper the Holy Spirit.</p> 

<p>The Christian who successfully lives by God's word is one who is continually 
filled with and controlled by the Spirit (<a href="kjv/ephesians_5.html#v18">Ephesians 5:18</a>) 
and who continually walks by the Spirit (<a href="kjv/galatians_5.html#v16">Galatians 5:16</a>).</p>

<p>The supernatural lifestyle can only be lived out by relinquishing self 
effort and by relying continually on our supernatural source, the Holy Spirit's <i>dunamis</i> (His inherent 
power) to accomplish Jesus' commands and instructions.</p>

<p>Beware of the natural tendency of our fallen flesh to deceive us into thinking 
we can do any of the commands and instructions in our own energy, lest we fall into the subtle 
trap of legalism!</p>

<h2>Daily Encouragement</h2>

<p>We are continually updating the ToDo list items and topics as well as providing daily tweets
of encouragement.</p>
