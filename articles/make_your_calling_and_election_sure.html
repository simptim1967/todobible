          <h2>Encouragement</h2>
	
		  <p>There are both wonderful promises and stern warnings as we study the verses of 
		  <a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v1">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:1-11</a>. There is also much good advice
		  and encouragement.</p>

          <div class="verse" style="color:#B6BEE0;">
              <b>1</b> Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, 
			  to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through 
			  the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
          </div>
          <!--v1 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained 
		  like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
		  -->
		  <p>The apostle Peter begins his second epistle by humbly coming along side fellow believers 
		  to greet and assure us that we have been given, and share in, the same "precious faith" through the righteousness 
		  that we have in Jesus Christ. At no point does Peter laud his authority over us as an apostle but instead 
		  approaches, as a fellow servant, in love and humility. However, we mustn't allow his gentle approach 
		  to sway us from the gravity of his message.</p> 
		  
          <h2>TODO: Increase in grace and peace through the knowledge of God and Jesus.</h2>
		  
          <div class="verse" style="color:#B6BEE0;">
              <b>2</b> Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, 
			  and of Jesus our Lord,
          </div>
          <!--v2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
		  -->
		  <p>Peter continues by expressing his earnest desire to see grace and peace increase in us abundantly 
		  as believers as we grow in knowledge (<i>epignosis</i> - experiential knowledge) of God and walk ever 
		  closer in our relationship with Jesus.</p>
		  
		  <h3>TODO: Know that knowing God is how His grace and peace become powerful in our lives.</h3>
		  
          <h2>PROMISE: Know that God has given us all we need for life and godliness.</h2>
		  
          <div class="verse" style="color:#B6BEE0;">
              <b>3</b> According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that <i>pertain</i> 
			  unto life and godliness, 
	          through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
          </div>
		  <!--v3a According as his divine power hath given unto us all things 
		  that pertain unto life and godliness, 
		  -->
		  <p>Through His divine power God has given us all we need for life and godliness
		  (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v3">2 Peter 1:3</a>). 
		  God wants us to be partakers of the divine nature (godliness). His divine power is the source
		  of the gifts that we are given.</p> 
		  
		  <p>Peter desperately wants us to understand this awesome promise:
		  that not only does God want us to partake of His holy nature but He has also empowered
		  us to attain it.</p>
		  
          <h2>PROMISE: Know that God has called us to glory and excellence.</h2>
		  
		  <!--v3b through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: 
		  -->
		  <p>He has called us to live for His glory in moral excellence and then to be with Him
		  in glory (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v3">2 Peter 1:3</a>). It is "through knowledge",
		  that is to say through knowing Him personally, and through knowing the certainty and empowering 
		  of His calling, that the gifts flow to us and are evidenced in us.</p>
		  
          <h3>TODO: Know with certainty that we are called with a holy calling.</h3>
		  
		  <p>(See <a href="../kjv/2timothy_1.html#v9">2 Timothy 1:9</a>, 
		  <a href="../kjv/romans_8.html#v30">Romans 8:30</a>.)</p>
		  
          <h2>PROMISE: Know that we are given exceeding great and precious promises.</h2>
		  
          <div class="verse" style="color:#B6BEE0;">
              <b>4</b> Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: 
	          that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, 
	          having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
          </div>
          <!--v4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: 
		  that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, 
		  having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
		  -->
		  <p>The gifts that are given to us are "exceeding great and precious promises" 
		  (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v4">2 Peter 1:4</a>).</p> 
		  
		  <p>These promises are the rock of Christ on which we can stand and hold firm in any storm. 
		  They equip us to overcome the sinful desires we face every day. They're weapons for the battle for 
		  faith, love and purity.</p> 
		  
		  <h2>PROMISE: Know that we are empowered to escape the sinful desires of the world.</h2>
		  
		  <p>It is through meditating on and believing and trusting in God's great and precious promises 
		  that we escape the corruption of the world by combatting and overcoming sinful desires. 
		  (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v4">2 Peter 1:4</a>)</p>
		  
		  <p>The sinful desires of the world promise us pleasure that they do not deliver in the long run
		  but God's holy nature is to be so satisfied in glory and excellence that there is no temptation to
		  sin whatsoever.</p>
		  
		  <h2>TODO: Become a partaker of the divine nature.</h2>
		  
		  <p>This is God's goal for us.</p>
		  
		  <p>We become partakers of the divine nature when we escape the sinful desires and corruption of the
		  world through the knowledge of God's glory and excellence. When we have tasted of this as a result of
		  the great and precious promises then we defeat sinful desires. 
		  (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v4">2 Peter 1:4</a>)</p>
		  
		  <p>When we conquer the promises of the world, which are deceitful, we share in the divine godliness.</p>
		  
		  <p>As true Christians it is our destiny to achieve this!</p>
		  
		  <h2>Liberating Promises Demand Action</h2>
		  
		  <p>For the very reason of these great God-given promises (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v3">2 Peter 1:3-4</a>)
		  the believer cannot be indifferent or self-satisfied. Such an abundance of divine grace calls for
		  total dedication.</p>
		  
		  <p>Even though God has poured His divine power into the believer, the Christian life 
		  is not lived to the honour of God without effort. We must not become lazy or complacent.</p> 
		  
		  <p>Believers are called to bear fruit knowing that trees which do not bring forth good fruit 
		  are "<woc>hewn down and cast into the fire</woc>" (<a href="../kjv/matthew_7.html#v19">Matthew 7:19</a>).</p>
		  
		  <p>It is for this reason that Peter commands the believer to diligently add to their faith
		  and lists seven qualities (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v5">2 Peter 1:5-7</a>) 
		  that are important for the believer to pursue in order to reach spiritual maturity and assure them 
		  self of their salvation.</p>
		   
		  <p>The apostle makes it his duty insisting that it is right for us to be continually reminded about 
		  these things (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v12">2 Peter 1:12</a>) and for us to keep them permanently
		  in remembrance (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v15">2 Peter 1:15</a>).</p>
		  
          <!--v5-7 
		  5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
		  6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
		  7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.

          <h2>Seven qualities to pursue most diligently.</h2>
		  
          <div class="verse" style="color:#B6BEE0;">
              <b>5</b> And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
          </div>
          <div class="verse" style="color:#B6BEE0;">
              <b>6</b> And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;

              <b>7</b> And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
          </div>

		  <p>The seven qualities described by Peter (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v5">2 Peter 1:5-7</a>) to be 
		  added to our faith and pursued most diligently include:</p>
		  
		  <ul>
		  <li><a href="#virtue">Virtue (moral excellence and fortitude)</a></li>
		  <li><a href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a></li>
		  <li><a href="#temperance">Temperance (self-control)</a></li>
		  <li><a href="#patience">Patience</a></li>
		  <li><a href="#godliness">Godliness</a></li>
		  <li><a href="#brotherly_kindness">Brotherly kindness</a></li>
		  <li><a href="#charity">Charity (<i>agape</i> love)</a></li>
		  </ul>
          
		  <p>The qualities listed are not meant to be approached in order. Each is to be pursued separately in its 
		  own merit. Whilst standing firm in our faith we must apply ourselves to grow spiritually in 
		  each quality, striving to advance and press in ever deeper. We need these additions to reach
		  the fullness of Christ (see Ephesians 3:19, 4:13). These additions are the elements of the very nature 
		  of God Himself.</p>

          <!--v6-->
          <!--v7-->
          <h2 id="virtue">TODO: Add to your faith virtue.</h2>
		  
		  <p>Our faith is the starting point that we are to add to.</p>
		  
          <p>"Virtue" is not an easy word to understand. Searches yield the meaning as "moral excellence and fortitude, 
		  active quality or power, manly strength or courage; valour."</p>
		  
		  <p>We must see "virtue" as not just power. No. It is the strength and power of God, emanating 
		  right out of His very heart through His Spirit into ours. It is He; it is a part of His 
		  divine nature; it is all about His strength and power stemming from His excellent goodness.  
		  This then is His power, which gives us now the strength and ability to go on the offensive 
		  against the devil and his tricks that block our road to immortality.</p>
		  
		  <p>This first addition to the faith, then, is an offensive weapon given to us by God to go with 
		  our trust-faith-assurance in Him. "Virtue" then is that quality of valour, that makes us like the 
		  mighty men of war as David was.  They were men of strength.  Mighty men.  Strong men and women 
		  in the Spirit, pro-active in their attacks on the enemy.  
		  This all comes in realising that it is God Almighty who does all this conquering – not only for us, 
		  but also in and through us.</p>
		  
		  <h2 id="knowledge">TODO: Add to virtue knowledge.</h2>
		  
          <p>"Knowledge" means understanding, correct insight, truth properly comprehended and applied. 
		  This quality involves a diligent study and pursuit of truth in both the Word of God and
		  relationship with God.</p>
          
		  <p>Adding knowledge then is all about first learning His true plan and promises and incorporating 
		  them into our thinking. This takes true teachings, much study and much communication with our Saviour.</p>
		  
		  !!! Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, 
		  rightly dividing the word of truth. (2 Timothy 2:15)
		  
		  <p>Knowledge is extremely important and necessary for godliness because it is through the knowledge
		  of God and knowing the certainty of His calling to share in His glory and excellence that we receive
		  the great and precious promises.</p>
          
		  <h2 id="temperance">TODO: Add to knowledge temperance.</h2>
		  
          <p>"Temperance" means self-control.
		  !!! self-control, overcome habitual sin, break harmful addictions, master your passions.</p>
          
		  <h2 id="patience">TODO: Add to temperance patience.</h2>
		  
          <p>!!! patience, perseverance, steadfastness !!!.
		  James 1
		  3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
		  4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
		  </p>
          
		  <h2 id="godliness">TODO: Add to patience godliness.</h2>
		  
          <p>!!! godliness/devoutness. holiness
		  partake of the divine nature (not becoming God but becoming like Him in His holiness)
		  by escaping the corruption of the world brought about by sinful desires</p>

		  <h2 id="brotherly_kindness">TODO: Add to godliness brotherly kindness.</h2>
		  
          <p>1 john says we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren.
		  !!! love is the evidence
		  !!! love the brethren
		  !!! don't be an accuser</p>
          
		  <h2 id="charity">TODO: Add to brotherly kindness charity.</h2>
		  
          <p>"Charity" here means "love" but this is no ordinary love, this is God's love,
		  translated from the Greek word "agape" meaning an unconditional love demanding 
		  nothing in return. This is the same "charity" (love) that is talked about in
		  <a href="../kjv/1corinthians_13.html">1 Corinthians 13</a>.</p>
	
          <p>It is this kind of love that we are to finally add to the divine nature within us now.
		  "Agape love is the bond of perfectness." It is that last attribute of God's divine nature 
		  that makes us complete in Him. It matures us, for when added, we will have been "conformed 
		  to the image of His Son."</p>

          </div>

          <p>A tree is known by its fruit and Peter says if you abound in doing the above things then you 
		  will not be unfruitful nor will you be ineffective in your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
		  (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v8">2 Peter 1:8</a>).</p>
		  
          <p>In other words, the believer who pursues the spiritual qualities mentioned above proves 
		  to them self by spiritual fruit that they are called (Rom. 8:30; 1 Peter 2:21) and chosen 
		  (1 Peter 1:2) by God to salvation.</p>

          <div class="verse" style="color:#B6BEE0;">
              <b>9</b> But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, 
			  and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
          </div>

		  <p>Peter warns about the believer who lacks the above qualities i.e. a believer
		  who chooses not to diligently pursue them. He describes such a person as "blind,
		  and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins"
		  (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v9">2 Peter 1:9</a>).</p>
		  
		  <p>To be "blind" is to shut your eyes to the truth that has been revealed in the Lord 
		  Jesus Christ. Such a person also "can't see afar off" i.e. they are short-sighted 
		  and they don't look to the future knowing full well where all things are heading: 
		  the judgement of God. Neither do they find the promises of God desirable. 
		  Instead they forget what Jesus has done for them. They forget that Jesus
		  purged their old sins and go back to living the same way as before. They do not seek
		  relationship with God and therefore lack knowledge becoming powerless.
		  To live as the world lives after you are saved will draw you away from salvation.</p>  
	 
	 	  <p>A professing Christian who is making no effort to attain the virtues mentioned above 
		  is unable to discern their true spiritual condition and therefore can have no assurance 
		  of salvation. Such a person will have no confidence about their profession of faith. 
		  They may possess all the blessings of <a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v3">2 Peter 1:3-4</a>, 
		  but without the excellences of <a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v5">2 Peter 1:5-7</a> they 
		  will live in doubt and fear.</p>

		  <h3>Christians must never stand still.</h3>
		  
          <p>The failure to diligently pursue these spiritual virtues produces spiritual amnesia. It is a 
		  very dangerous thing not to grow in God. The one-time experience of salvation is not
		  enough. We are either growing in Christ or we are going backwards. We can never stand still.</p> 

          <p>Salvation is a daily walk through life, growing each day more like Jesus. To do anything else
		  will not work. We can be blinded by the world, if we are not careful, and forget the forgiveness
		  we received in Christ.</p>
		  
          <h2>TODO: Examine yourself to see if you are in the faith.</h2>
		  
		  <p>Paul challenges the believer to "examine yourself" 
		  (see <a href="../kjv/2corinthians_13.html#v5">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>)
		  and "prove to yourself" that you are in the faith.</p>
		  
		  <p>As believers we must be confident that God's Holy Spirit dwells in us and bears witness to
		  our spirit that we are children of God (see <a href="../kjv/romans_8.html#v16">Romans 8:16</a>).
		  Don't let the enemy cause you to doubt based on your feelings. Ignore how you feel.</p>
		  
		  <p>Instead rely on the truth of what God's Word says: recognise the good fruit you are bearing, 
		  your love for the Word of God, your hatred of sin, your love for your Christian brethren and 
		  your endless pursuit of knowledge and godliness. If you don't see these virtues then it's time to 
		  take Peter's following warning and advice to heart.</p>
		  
          <!--v10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: 
		  for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:

          <h2>WARNING: Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.</h2>
		  
		  <div class="verse" style="color:#B6BEE0;">
    	  <b>10</b> Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: 
		  for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
		  </div>

		  <p>Peter warns us that as believers we are not just to make our calling and election sure but 
		  we are to "give diligence" to confirm it (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v10">2 Peter 1:10</a>). 
		  That means giving it our full attention without delay.</p> 
		  
		  <p>We are instructed by Paul to "work out your own salvation in fear and trembling" 
		  (<a href="../kjv/philippians_2.html#v12">Philippians 2:12-13</a>) and to "run so as to
		  obtain the prize" (<a href="../kjv/1corinthians_9.html#v24">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>).</p>
		  
		  <p>The Lord Jesus Himself too gives us the priority to "<woc>Seek ye first the kingdom of God and 
		  His righteousness</woc>" (<a href="../kjv/matthew_6.html#v33">Matthew 6:25-33</a>) above worrying
		  about all the other things we might need each day.</p>
		  
          <h3>How can I make my calling and election sure?</h3>
		  
		  <p>Amongst the other favourite weapons of the enemy are "lies" and "doubt". The enemy wants 
		  to convince us that we are not saved and that we must do many things to earn God's election. 
		  Nothing could be further from the truth! God wants us to be assured of our salvation.</p>
		  
		  <p>As believers we must trust the Word of God to overcome any doubts that we may have about 
		  our calling and acknowledge that God has already done everything necessary on our behalf 
		  to enable us to walk out that calling and thereby evidence our election.</p>
		  
		  <p>Election is the free gift of God by grace and cannot be earned. It is God that works in us
		  both to will and to do of His good pleasure (see <a href="../kjv/philippians_2.html#v13">Philippians 2:13</a>).</p>
		  
          <!--v10a-->
          <h2>TODO: Confirm your election and be assured of your salvation.</h2>
		  
	      <p>Though God is certain who His elect are, and has given them an eternally secure salvation 
		  that cannot be taken away, at times the individual Christian them self might not have such 
		  assurance of their salvation. For this reason, Peter explains how a believer can be assured
		  and compells us to "give all diligence" to assure ourselves.</p>

		  <p>God predestined that all of the elect become like Jesus 
		  (see <a href="../kjv/romans_8.html#v29">Romans 8:29</a>). Therefore
		  the reassuring confirmation that we are among the elect is that we are becoming like
		  Jesus. We desire and strive continually to become Christ-like. As a result we witness the good 
		  fruit we bear and are known by it. This assures us of our salvation. We learn by doing!</p>
		  
		  <p>Thus, the confirmation of our election is our progress in sanctification.</p>
		  
          <!--v10b-->
          <h2>PROMISE: If ye do these things, ye shall never fall.</h2>
		  
		  <p>The apostle promises that "if ye do these things, ye shall never fall" 
		  (<a href="../kjv/2peter_1.html#v10">2 Peter 1:10</a>).</p>
		  
		  <p>As the Christian pursues the qualities listed by Peter (verses 5-7) and sees that 
		  their life is useful and fruitful (verse 8), they will not stumble into doubt, despair, fear
		  or questioning but enjoy the full assurance of their salvation.</p>

		  <p>We don't do these things to earn our election but rather to confirm that we have been called.</p>
	
<div class="verse" style="color:#B6BEE0;">
    <b>11</b> For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
</div>
          <!--v11-->
		  <h2>PROMISE: Entrance will be given to you into the everlasting kingdom.</h2>
		  
“Entrance … ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom”: Dedicated Christians, who grow 
and become fruitful, cultivating through God’s provision and power the prime qualities of faith – virtue, 
knowledge, self-control, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and brotherly love – will never stumble or fall.

Peter piles up the words to bring joy to the weary Christian's heart. An abundant entrance into eternal 
heaven is the hope and reality for a Christian who lives a faithful, fruitful life here on earth. Peter's 
point is that a Christian who pursues the list virtues (verses 5-7) will not only enjoy assurance in the 
present, but a full, rich reward in the future life (1 Cor. 4:5; Rev. 22:12). A full reward awaits the 
faithful, godly believer in Christ's ever-lasting kingdom (see Eph. 2:6-7).
	  
	      <h2>Challenge</h2>
	
		  <ul>
		  <li>Have you grasped the exceeding great and precious promises given to you by God?</li>
		  <li>Are you making every effort to grow in moral excellence?</li>
		  <li>Are you making every effort to increase your knowledge of God's character and His will
		  by living in relationship with Him?</li>
		  <li>Are you making every effort to strengthen your power of self-control over the
		  passions in your life that would otherwise lead you astray?</li>
		  <li>Are you making every effort to enlarge your capacity for patience?</li>
		  <li>Are you making every effort to cultivate godliness to develop a heart for God?</li>
		  <li>Are you making every effort to grow warm in your affection for your fellow believers?</li>
		  <li>And are you making every effort to stir up love in your will for the person you dislike the most?</li>
		  </ul>

	      <h2>Call To Action</h2>

          <p>Don't wait. Examine yourself and begin making the necessary changes with God's help.</p>
		  <p>Fight the good fight of faith and lay hold on eternal life.</p>
		  <p>TODO: Give diligence to make your calling and election sure!</p>
		  		  
          <h2>Prayer</h2>
	
	      <p>Heavenly Father,<br>
		  The only true God,<br> 
	      Give me an overwhelming desire for you.<br>
		  Set my eyes on the things above.<br>
		  Give me eternal perspective.<br>
		  .<br>
		  .<br>
		  .<br>
		  .<br>
		  Teach me to be holy like you.<br>
