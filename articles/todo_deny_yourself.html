          <h2>Encouragement</h2>
	
          <p>
		  The world tells us that to live in denial is a bad thing and that we should follow our heart
		  and deny ourselves nothing. That's not what Jesus said. He said the opposite.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  When I first started to write this article I wanted to create three separate ToDo items, 
          namely:<br />
		  1) Deny yourself<br />
		  2) Take up your cross daily<br />
		  3) Follow Jesus
		  </p> 
		  
		  <p>
		  Over time I came to realise that these three instructions are inseparable for anyone who truly wishes 
          to be a disciple of Jesus. Hence all three are discussed in this same article.
		  </p>
	 
          <h2>TODO: Deny Yourself</h2>
		  
          <h3>What does it mean to deny yourself?</h3>
		  
		  <p>
		  One Sunday my Pastor gave our church the mnemonic "J.O.Y." regarding discipleship priorities:<br />
		  J: Jesus first,<br /> 
		  O: Others second<br />
		  Y: Yourself last!
		  </p> 
		  
		  <p>
		  When you do that, you are denying yourself and putting God first. That is exactly what Jesus did.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  Jesus came to speak the words of the Father and to do His will.
		  </p>
		  
		  <div class="versebox">
		  <woc>&ldquo;For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,
		  he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.&rdquo;</woc>
		  <a href="../kjv/john_12.html#v49">John 12:49</a>
		  </div>

		  <div class="versebox">
		  <woc>&ldquo;My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.&rdquo;</woc>
		  <a href="../kjv/john_4.html#v34">John 4:34</a>
		  </div>

		  <p>
		  Jesus only said and did those things that pleased the Father.
		  </p>
		  
		  <div class="versebox">
		  <woc>&ldquo;And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone;
		  for I do always those things that please him.&rdquo;</woc>
		  <a href="../kjv/john_8.html#v29">John 8:29</a>
		  </div>
		  
		  <p>
		  To deny yourself is to say to God "Thy will be done, not mine", and mean it.
		  It's also to hear Jesus speaking, and to do it.
		  </p>
		  
          <h3>Why must you deny yourself?</h3>
		  
          <p>
		  For the Christian, self-denial is not an option, it's a MUST.
		  </p>
	
		  <div class="versebox">
		  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.
		  <a href="../kjv/proverbs_14.html#v12">Proverbs 14:12</a>
		  </div>
		  
          <p>
		  You can't follow Jesus if you can't, won't or don't deny yourself. 
		  That's what Jesus did, so you wouldn't be following Him if you didn't do it too.
		  It's also what Jesus is telling us to do.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  Whilst you are still clinging to your own selfish desires and choices you are 
		  choosing not to surrender your life fully to Christ but rather to hold onto it. Jesus
		  warns us directly against this: 
		  </p>
		  		  
		  <div class="versebox">
		    <woc>&ldquo;For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will
                  lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.&rdquo;</woc>
		    <a href="../kjv/luke_9.html#v24">Luke 9:24</a>
		  </div>
	
		  <p>
		  The Christian must therefore lay down their life for His sake in order to save it.
		  It's a choice that shows where our trust truly resides.
	      </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  Note: This should rightly be considered as a great and precious promise as well as 
		  a warning from Jesus. The promised reward is everlasting life!
	      </p>
		  
		  <h3>How do you deny yourself?</h3>
		  
	      <p>
		  Self-denial is a choice that often requires a higher level of spiritual maturity to achieve.
		  Jesus was a man fully in communion with God. 
		  Jesus was fully annointed with the Holy Spirit "without measure" (John 3:34). 
		  Jesus was also in no doubt about His relationship with His heavenly Father.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  As Christians we too must be fully in relationship with God else otherwise how will we hear Him speak?
		  We must be sure of our own identity in Christ through the presence of the in-dwelling Holy Spirit
		  and the great and precious promises given to us. 
		  We must also know God's character and will.
		  We can learn this from regularly reading God's Word and by communing with God in prayer and fasting
		  utilising the Holy Spirit as our teacher.
		  
!!! you don't because you can't - however, God's grace enables us to when we draw near to God and abide in Christ
!!! conviction that God knows best
!!! God wants us free from sinful living
!!! all of our ways take us away from god not nearer to Him
		  
		  It's impossible for a man to follow his own will and follow the will of God. 
		  You have to choose one or the other - either denying God's will to follow your own, 
		  or denying yourself to follow the will of God. But even when we choose to deny ourself we
		  find our will power is not enough! 
		  
		  If you've tried to do this, failed, tried harder, still failed, gotten frustrated 
		  (mourned over your sin) and 
		  desperate you are eventually forced to cry out to God over it as you haven't yet realised that
		  you are powerless to achieve this without Jesus. (Blessed are the poor in spirit, and those that mourn)
		  
	      </p>

          <p>
		  To deny yourself requires you to submit and surrender fully to God, putting your own life 
		  to death with Christ and choosing to walk in the Spirit in order to do, with His grace, only 
		  that which the Father wills. It means setting aside your own worldly 
		  ambitions and overcoming your fleshly lusts (<a href="../kjv/1john_2.html#v15">1 John 2:15-17</a>)
		  as you grow up fully into Christ.
		  Only then can we truly fulfil our divine purpose as Jesus did.
		  </p> 
          
!!! does this fit here

		  <div class="versebox">
		  &ldquo;When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, 
          I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.&rdquo; 
		  <a href="../kjv/1corinthians_13.html#v11">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>

          <p>We put away childish things when we stop focussing on ourselves 
		  ("me" prayers with the wrong motives - see <a href="../kjv/james_4.html#v3">James 4:3</a>) 
		  and start focussing on what He wants us to do.<br> 
		  <span style="color:purple;">// Remember: We are here for His glory.</span></p>
		  
		  <p>The context in which Jesus tells us to deny ourself and take up our cross 
		  is preceded by the prophecy of His suffering, death and resurrection 
		  (<a href="../kjv/luke_9.html#v22">Luke 9:22</a>) 
		  followed by the futility of pursuing a worldly life only to lose it 
		  (<a href="../kjv/luke_9.html#v24">Luke 9:24-26</a>), 
		  instead of following His example which leads to eternal life. All of the gospels
		  align on the need to die to self for Jesus.</p>
	
          <p>Jesus denied himself and went to the cross on our behalf. He took the condemnation, 
		  the shame and the punishment that you and I rightly deserve. He didn't want to. But 
		  after three bouts of face-down, agonising prayer and sweating great drops of blood 
		  (<a href="../kjv/luke_22.html#v44">Luke 22:44</a>) He did it.</p>
		  
		  <p>The Father didn't force Jesus to do this (<a href="../kjv/john_10.html#v18">John 10:18</a>) 
		  but He chose to lay down His life because it pleased the 
		  Father (<a href="../kjv/matthew_26.html#v39">Matthew 26:39</a>) and knowing that it was for
		  this hour that He came into the world (<a href="../kjv/john_12.html#v27">John 12:27</a>). 
		  He was obedient even unto death. <span style="color:purple;">// Amazing act of love!</span></p> 

          <p>
		  Death to self is what enables us to bear much good fruit because we seek His will, not ours.
		  The Father will never prompt us to do anything sinful - although the enemy will. We must again
		  deny ourselves and endure such temptations which mercifully the Father always provides a way out of. 
		  </p>
		  
		  <div class="versebox">
		  <woc>&ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.<br>
 	      &nbsp;He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.&rdquo;</woc>		
		  <a href="../kjv/john_12.html#v24">John 12:24-25</a>
		  </div>
		  	
		  <p>Don't expect denying yourself to be easy. It isn't and never will be because the spirit and the flesh 
		  are in constant battle (<a href="../kjv/galatians_5.html#v17">Galatians 5:17</a>) so that we can't 
		  do the things that we want to (<a href="../kjv/romans_7.html#v18">Romans 7:18-20</a>) whilst we still
		  walk in the flesh. But fortunately  
		  for us we do not war after the flesh when we walk in the Spirit: our weapons are not carnal but mighty 
		  through God 
		  (<a href="../kjv/2corinthians_10.html#v3">2 Corinthians 10:3-4</a>).</p>
		   
		  <div class="versebox">
		  <woc>&ldquo;They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with
		   the<br>
		    affections and lusts.&rdquo;</woc>		
		  <a href="../kjv/galatians_5.html#v24">Galatians 5:24</a>
		  </div>
		  	
		  <p>First we must act. Our obedience, resulting in acts of self denial, become a catalyst 
		  when combined with prayer asking for the grace to continually walk in the Spirit in order
		  to overcome the lusts of the flesh (<a href="../kjv/galatians_5.html#v16">Galatians 5:16</a>) and  
		  mortify the deeds of the body (<a href="../kjv/romans_8.html#v13">Romans 8:13</a>).</p>
		   
		  <p>We must both act and ask. We can't just lapse into sinning whilst we wait for the Spirit to 
		  act on our behalf! But we also can't do this on our own. Hence we cry Abba, Father. We ask
		  for help and let Jesus help us. We have to wait patiently on the Lord in hope 
		  (<a href="../kjv/romans_8.html#v11">Romans 8:11-30</a>) and while 
		  doing so we use the very word of God. 
		  We look away, so that we don't look lustfully. 
		  We cross the road in avoidance, so we don't even pass by evil. 
		  We part company with fools, so we don't behave foolishly etc.
		  It is only through the Spirit pleading on our behalf that we finally overcome, bringing into 
		  captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ 
		  (<a href="../kjv/2corinthians_10.html#v5">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>). 
		  <span style="color:purple;">// Remember: God always provides an escape route for us from temptation!</span>
		  (<a href="../kjv/1corinthians_10.html#v13">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>)</p>
		  
		  <p>
		  But none of this happens accidentally. This is something that we must want to do so badly 
		  that we are prepared to take it by force (<a href="../kjv/matthew_11.html#v12">Matthew 11:12</a>);
		  even to the extent of cutting off a hand or foot, or plucking out an eye.
		  Jesus says to do just that if necessary (<a href="../kjv/matthew_5.html#v29">Matthew 5:29</a>,
		  <a href="../kjv/matthew_18.html#v8"> 18:8-9</a>).
		  <span style="color:purple;">// How serious are you? How badly do you want this?</span>
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  When we give in to temptation we remain a slave to sin. But when we resist sowing to the flesh
		  we become a slave to righteousness.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  Jesus tells us to watch and pray so that we don't fall into temptation.
		  There are 1440 minutes in a day. How many minutes do you spend in prayer each day?
		  Where do you spend your time?
		  Is it watching television?
		  Are you addicted to exercising (which profits little) or social networking?
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  Through perseverance and prayer we obtain the grace to stop sowing to the flesh and thereby 
		  overcome the unhealthy lusts of the flesh. 
		  Sowing to the flesh reaps corruption and death but instead we sow to the Spirit and reap 
		  life everlasting (<a href="../kjv/galatians_6.html#v8">Galatians 6:8</a>).
		  </p>
		  		  
		  <p>When we love God and seek Him with all our heart, soul, strength and mind it is the 
		  Father's good will to give us what we ask for. But we must ask in faith without 
		  wavering (<a href="../kjv/james_1.html#v6">James 1:6</a>).
		  This is the only way we can overcome and deny ourself to make ourselves available for use
		  by Him in His purposes.</p>
		  
	      <h2>TODO: Take Up Your Cross (Daily)</h2>
		  
		  <p>
		  Jesus was deadly serious about His work. He was totally prepared to die for it.
		  </p>
		  
<!--
		  <p>
		  Just as He took up His cross at the Father's request, so Jesus tells us that we  
		  must take up our cross. We each have our very own cross and 
		  we must take it up daily, without compromise, and do as He did.
		  </p>
--> 
		  
		  <p>
		  Don't think that your cross is something that you get to carry around with you like a burden.
		  In the days of Jesus crosses were made and intended for only one purpose: to die on.
		  </p>
		  
<!--
		  <p>
		  You must carry your cross like He did to the place of execution where you must lay
		  down and die on it. The "old man" which is trapped in bondage to sin must be crucified with 
		  Christ so that the "new man" can be likewise raised up in Christ and reign in life
		  as the servant of righteousness.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  Our cross is to do God's will for our life. It requires us to give up our life and do what 
		  the Father asks us to do, following in the footsteps of Jesus as a disciple, even unto death 
		  if necessary.
		  </p>
-->
		  
		  <p> 
		  Crucifixion was a brutal method of torture and execution used by the Romans for criminals. 
		  Death on the cross was shameful, excruciatingly painful and slow.
		  </p>
	
		  <p>Those condemned to death by crucifixion were expected to carry their own cross,
		  usually through the heart of the city, to the place of execution which was 
		  often preceded by vicious whipping and other cruel forms of torture.</p>
		  
		  <p>Jesus predicted and experienced these very things and we must never
		  underestimate the price that He paid on the cross for us. 
		  He was beaten beyond recognition and spilled His blood for us even though He was innocent
		  and without sin. His great love for us and for the Father was proven by His utmost
		  obedience to the Father.
		  </p> 
		  
		  <p>
		  The enormous price that Jesus paid on the cross for us was not the measure of our
          sin but rather of the value that the Father places on our lives!
		  </p> 
		  
		  <div class="versebox">
		  <woc>&ldquo;Greater love hath no man than this,<br />
		  that a man lay down his life for his friends.&rdquo;</woc>		
		  <a href="../kjv/john_15.html#v13">John 15:13</a>
		  </div>
		  	
		  <p>
		  To Jesus, being obedient to the Father's will was more important than taking offence at wrongful
		  accusation, than needing to retaliate when attacked or than caring about what men thought. He
		  was prepared to both suffer and die wrongfully for His obedience. 
		  <span style="color:purple;">// Is that a picture of you?</span>
		  </p>
	
		  <p>
		  About Jesus Christ, God the Father says:
		  </p>
	
		  <div class="versebox">
		  &ldquo;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo;		
		  <a href="../kjv/matthew_17.html#v5">Matthew 17:5</a>
		  </div>
		  	
		  <p>
		  And why? Because He lived a life of obedience unto death, even death on a cross. 
          </p>
		  
		  <p>When we take up our cross each day, the same love and obedience
		  is expected of us too, otherwise we are not worthy of Him.
		  </p>
		  
		  <div class="versebox">
		  <woc>&ldquo;And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me,<br />
		  is not worthy of me.&rdquo;</woc>		
		  <a href="../kjv/matthew_10.html#v38">Matthew 10:38</a>
		  </div>
		  	
		  <p>
		  When we take up our cross, what we are taking up is a death sentence to self. 
		  It's a life that demonstrates our love and total committment to God.
		  <span style="color:purple;">// How serious are you?</span>
		  </p>
	
		  <h2>TODO: Follow Jesus</h2>
		  
		  <p>Jesus said to the disciples "<woc>Follow me</woc>" and their response was to drop everything
		  right then and there and to go with Him. Jesus offers us the same invitation today, to come
		  just as we are, and walk with Him.</p>
		  
		  <p>
		  The word "follow" in this verse is the Greek word "akoloutheo" which may also be translated as 
		  meaning to take the same road or to accompany as a disciple.
		  </p>
		   
          <p>Following Jesus means forsaking everything (withholding nothing) to become a disciple.
		  It will bring you into condemnation with the world. You will be hated, ridiculed, 
	      wrongly accused, spat upon. You may be beaten, imprisoned, tortured. You may even be killed for it.</p>

		  <div class="versebox">
		    &ldquo;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
			against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
			wickedness in high places.&rdquo;
		    <a href="../kjv/ephesians_6.html#v12">Ephesians 6:12</a>
		  </div>

          <p>Having put the old man to death in Christ we are now seated in heaven, seeing with 
		  a heavenly perspective. We are no longer bound by our fleshly limitations and God will 
		  never ask us to do anything that He will not also provide for and enable us to do
		  through the Holy Spirit. We walk by faith and not by sight 
		  (<a href="../kjv/2corinthians_5.html#v7">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>), as soldiers of Christ 
		  trusting in God for all things without fear.</p>

		  <div class="versebox">
		    &ldquo;No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; 
	        that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.&rdquo;
		    <a href="../kjv/2timothy_2.html#v4">2 Timothy 2:4</a>
		  </div>
		  
		  <p>Following Jesus means doing the things that Jesus did. These are the good works that we
		  are called to do. These aren't good works to earn righteousness or make us righteous as we 
		  are justified when we accept His work on the cross by faith.</p>
		  
		  <div class="versebox">
		    <woc>&ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do
			shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.&rdquo;</woc>
		    <a href="../kjv/john_14.html#v12">John 14:12</a>
		  </div>
		  
		  <p>
!!!
   		  follow me is also talking to those who will come long after Jesus in the future
		  and is a direction to continue His work in greater volumes (HS told me this) but they should
		  not think that they are following in past footsteps but rather are being led by the hand of Jesus
		  as they walk with Him to do this work. What we read is the written word but what we follow is 
		  the living word, Jesus Himself going with us as we follow.

God wants us to hear His voice and to follow Him. 

Jesus said:
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me (John 10:27)
And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. (John 10:5)
		  
!!!! Mike Cleveland says:

		  Taking up our cross means sacrificing our flesh, not gratifying it. 
		  It means dying to self, not living to please the flesh. 
		  </p>
		  
		  <h3>Jesus Was Not Alone - Nor Are We</h3>

          <p>Jesus was never alone as the Father was always with Him (<a href="../kjv/john_8.html#v29">John 8:29</a>). 
		  Neither are we ever alone because the Holy Spirit dwells within each of us as believers.
		  He goes with us everywhere we go, empowering us to say and do the work of the Father if we will
		  hear and follow His voice.</p>
		  		  
<!--
		  <p>Paul reminds us to look to Jesus as the author and finisher of our faith 
		  (<a href="../kjv/hebrews_12.html#v2">Hebrews 12:2</a>).
		  Jesus doesn't author our faith with ink "but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables
		  of stone but in the fleshy tables of the heart" 
		  (<a href="../kjv/2corinthians_3.html#v3">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>).</p>
		  
		  <p>Jesus wants to write on your heart right now. <span style="color:purple;">// Will you let Him?</span></p>
-->

		  <h3>Forsaking Everything For God</h3>
		  
		  <p>As Christians we are indebted to Jesus for His supreme sacrifice
		  on the cross that paid for our salvation by redeeming us from our sins. Through His blood
		  we are washed clean. Our sins are blotted out.</p>
		  
		  <p>In thankfulness to God for His mercy, is it too much to ask that we give up our
		  lives as a living sacrifice for Jesus and for the sake of the gospel? The apostle Paul
		  describes this as our reasonable service by which we demonstrate 
		  the perfect will of God (<a href="../kjv/romans_12.html#v1">Romans 12:1-2</a>).</p>
		  
		  <p>You already know that if you try to retain your worldly life you will lose it.
		  <span style="color:purple;">// So why hang onto it?</span></p>
		   
	      <h2>Challenge</h2>
	
		  <ul>
		  <li>Do you love God more than the world?</li>
	      <li>Do you love the Father enough to give up your life?</li>
	      <li>Are you willing to take up your cross daily?</li>
	      <li>Are you willing to forsake all and follow Jesus?</li>
	      <li>Have you died to self?</li>
		  <li>When was the last time you denied yourself?</li>
	      <li>Whose will have you been doing today?</li>
		  </ul>

	      <h2>Call To Action</h2>

          <p>Don't wait. Make the decision and live by it.</p>
		  <p>TODO: Deny yourself and take up your cross daily and follow Jesus!</p>
		  		  
          <h2>Prayer</h2>
	
	      <p>Heavenly Father,<br>
		  The only true God,<br> 
	      Please teach me how to deny myself for your glory.<br>
		  So that I might turn my back on all that is of the world.<br>
		  So that I might seek you with my whole heart.<br>
		  So that I might do your will, and not my own.<br>
		  Give me grace to walk continually in the Spirit.<br>
		  Help me to see and to hear clearly what you would have me say and do.<br>
		  Keep me from all distractions.<br>
		  Help me to take up my cross and die to self each day, just like Jesus did.<br>
		  Cause me to always respond in love, and to never take offense.<br>
		  That I may truly be a disciple of Jesus.<br>
		  And follow Him, walking with Him each day.<br>  
          I pray this in the name of Jesus my Lord and Saviour.</p>
	      
		  <p>Amen.</p>
