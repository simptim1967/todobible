      <verse number="1" id="v1">For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Now consider how great this man &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt;, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And here men that die receive tithes; but there he &lt;span class='extra'&gt;receiveth them&lt;/span&gt;, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was there&lt;/span&gt; that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">For &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">For he testifieth, Thou &lt;span class='extra'&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope &lt;span class='extra'&gt;did&lt;/span&gt;; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And inasmuch as not without an oath &lt;span class='extra'&gt;he was made priest&lt;/span&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou &lt;span class='extra'&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">But this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;man&lt;/span&gt;, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">For such an high priest became us, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;who is&lt;/span&gt; holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;maketh&lt;/span&gt; the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</verse>
