      <verse number="1" id="v1">And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard &lt;span class='extra'&gt;those things&lt;/span&gt;, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And to the kings that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">&lt;span class='extra'&gt;And to&lt;/span&gt; the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.</verse>

      <verse number="8" id="v8">And the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And Joshua did unto them as the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.</verse>

      <verse number="12" id="v12">And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; commanded.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">But &lt;span class='extra'&gt;as for&lt;/span&gt; the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; did Joshua burn.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">As the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; commanded Moses.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;</verse>

      <verse number="21" id="v21" newPara="true">And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.</verse>
