      <verse number="1" id="v1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Stand in the gate of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, all &lt;span class="extra"&gt;ye of&lt;/span&gt; Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, The temple of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, The temple of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; these.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;If&lt;/span&gt; ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">But go ye now unto my place which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Therefore will I do unto &lt;span class="extra"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the whole seed of Ephraim.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead &lt;span class="extra"&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Do they provoke me to anger? saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="extra"&gt;do they&lt;/span&gt; not &lt;span class="extra"&gt;provoke&lt;/span&gt; themselves to the confusion of their own faces?</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Therefore thus saith the Lord &lt;span class="nog"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21" newPara="true">Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">But thou shalt say unto them, This &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29" newPara="true">Cut off thine hair, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;O Jerusalem&lt;/span&gt;, and cast &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And they have built the high places of Tophet, which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; not, neither came it into my heart.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32" newPara="true">Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; away.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.</verse>
