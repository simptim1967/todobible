      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's &lt;span class="extra"&gt;son&lt;/span&gt;, which should betray him,</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Then said Jesus, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; they had done these things unto him.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23" newPara="true">And Jesus answered them, saying, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will &lt;span class="extra"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; Father honour.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Father, glorify thy name.&lt;/span&gt; Then came there a voice from heaven, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;saying&lt;/span&gt;, I have both glorified &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, and will glorify &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; again.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">The people therefore, that stood by, and heard &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Jesus answered and said, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all &lt;span class="extra"&gt;men&lt;/span&gt; unto me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">This he said, signifying what death he should die.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;The Son of man must be lifted up?&lt;/span&gt; who is this Son of man?</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">Then Jesus said unto them, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.&lt;/span&gt; These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37" newPara="true">But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with &lt;span class="extra"&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; eyes, nor understand with &lt;span class="extra"&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42" newPara="true">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt;, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44" newPara="true">Jesus cried and said, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="49" id="v49">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="50" id="v50">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
