      <verse number="1" id="v1">And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks &lt;span class="extra"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt; when they were gone out of the city, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; not &lt;span class="extra"&gt;yet&lt;/span&gt; far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt; not this &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And he said, Now also &lt;span class="extra"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; it &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And he searched, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And Joseph said unto them, What deed &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; my lord's servants, both we, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;he&lt;/span&gt; also with whom the cup is found.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And he said, God forbid that I should do so: &lt;span class="extra"&gt;but&lt;/span&gt; the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou &lt;span class="extra"&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; even as Pharaoh.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for &lt;span class="extra"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; he should leave his father, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his father&lt;/span&gt; would die.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And our father said, Go again, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; buy us a little food.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; with us.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two &lt;span class="extra"&gt;sons&lt;/span&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; not &lt;span class="extra"&gt;with us&lt;/span&gt;, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</verse>
