      <verse number="1" id="v1">The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; to serve other gods, whom they knew not, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;neither&lt;/span&gt; they, ye, nor your fathers.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; desolate, as at this day.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Therefore now thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye &lt;span class="extra"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">They are not humbled &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">Therefore thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; fall in the land of Egypt; they shall &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; be consumed by the sword &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;As for&lt;/span&gt; the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, we will not hearken unto thee.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for &lt;span class="extra"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all &lt;span class="extra"&gt;things&lt;/span&gt;, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; answer, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; remember them, and came it &lt;span class="extra"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; into his mind?</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">So that the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and have not obeyed the voice of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, all Judah that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; in the land of Egypt:</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">Therefore hear ye the word of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord &lt;span class="nog"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt; liveth.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29" newPara="true">And this &lt;span class="extra"&gt;shall be&lt;/span&gt; a sign unto you, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.</verse>
