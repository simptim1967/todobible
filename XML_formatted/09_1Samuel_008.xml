      <verse number="1" id="v1">And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: &lt;span class='extra'&gt;they were&lt;/span&gt; judges in Beer-sheba.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">And Samuel told all the words of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; unto the people that asked of him a king.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; for himself, for his chariots, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;to be&lt;/span&gt; his horsemen; and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; shall run before his chariots.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;will set them&lt;/span&gt; to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And he will take your daughters &lt;span class='extra'&gt;to be&lt;/span&gt; confectionaries, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;to be&lt;/span&gt; cooks, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;to be&lt;/span&gt; bakers.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the best &lt;span class='extra'&gt;of them&lt;/span&gt;, and give &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; to his servants.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; to his work.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will not hear you in that day.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19" newPara="true">Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</verse>
