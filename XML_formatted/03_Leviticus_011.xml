      <verse number="33" id="v33">And every earthen vessel, whereinto &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of them falleth, whatsoever &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">Of all meat which may be eaten, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; on which &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; vessel shall be unclean.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">And every &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt; whereupon &lt;i&gt;any part&lt;/i&gt; of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; &lt;i&gt;whether it be&lt;/i&gt; oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.</verse>

      <verse number="45" id="v45">For I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; holy.</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47">To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.</verse>
