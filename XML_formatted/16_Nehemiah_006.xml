      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in &lt;i&gt;some one of&lt;/i&gt; the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Wherein &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith &lt;i&gt;it, that&lt;/i&gt; thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, &lt;i&gt;There is&lt;/i&gt; a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, &lt;i&gt;O God&lt;/i&gt;, strengthen my hands.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who &lt;i&gt;is there&lt;/i&gt;, that, &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; as I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt;, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Therefore &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; they might have &lt;i&gt;matter&lt;/i&gt; for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth &lt;i&gt;day&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;the month&lt;/i&gt; Elul, in fifty and two days.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard &lt;i&gt;thereof&lt;/i&gt;, and all the heathen that &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; about us saw &lt;i&gt;these things&lt;/i&gt;, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and &lt;i&gt;the letters&lt;/i&gt; of Tobiah came unto them.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">For &lt;i&gt;there were&lt;/i&gt; many in Judah sworn unto him, because he &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. &lt;i&gt;And&lt;/i&gt; Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</verse>
