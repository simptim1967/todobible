      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">I know &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt; so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;i&gt;He is&lt;/i&gt; wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened &lt;i&gt;himself&lt;/i&gt; against him, and hath prospered?</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">&lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">How much less shall I answer him, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; choose out my words &lt;i&gt;to reason&lt;/i&gt; with him?</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Whom, though I were righteous, &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; would I not answer, &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; I would make supplication to my judge.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">If I had called, and he had answered me; &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">If &lt;i&gt;I speak&lt;/i&gt; of strength, lo, &lt;i&gt;he is&lt;/i&gt; strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time &lt;i&gt;to plead&lt;/i&gt;?</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: &lt;i&gt;if I say&lt;/i&gt;, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">&lt;i&gt;Though&lt;/i&gt; I &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; perfect, &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; one &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;, therefore I said &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; who &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; he?</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; hasteth to the prey.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort &lt;i&gt;myself&lt;/i&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">&lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">For &lt;i&gt;he is&lt;/i&gt; not a man, as I &lt;i&gt;am, that&lt;/i&gt; I should answer him, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; we should come together in judgment.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; might lay his hand upon us both.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">&lt;i&gt;Then&lt;/i&gt; would I speak, and not fear him; but &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt; not so with me.</verse>
