      <verse number="1" id="v1">Afterward he brought me to the gate, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; the gate that looketh toward the east:</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And &lt;i&gt;it was&lt;/i&gt; according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And the glory of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; toward the east.</verse>

      <verse number="6" id="v6">And I heard &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, &lt;i&gt;neither&lt;/i&gt; they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.</verse>

      <verse number="12" id="v12">This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; most holy. Behold, this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the law of the house.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13" newPara="true">And these &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; a span: and this &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; the higher place of the altar.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And from the bottom &lt;i&gt;upon&lt;/i&gt; the ground &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; to the lower settle &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; to the greater settle &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; four cubits, and the breadth &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; cubit.</verse>

      <verse number="20" id="v20">And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.</verse>

      <verse number="22" id="v22">And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; with the bullock.</verse>

      <verse number="25" id="v25">Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.</verse>
