      <verse number="2" id="v2">And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Such as &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; for death, to death; and such as &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; for the sword, to the sword; and such as &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; for the famine, to the famine; and such as &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; for the captivity, to the captivity.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; which he did in Jerusalem.</verse>

      <verse number="6" id="v6">Thou hast forsaken me, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; of children, I will destroy my people, &lt;i&gt;since&lt;/i&gt; they return not from their ways.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while &lt;i&gt;it was&lt;/i&gt; yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; every one of them doth curse me.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt; in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</verse>

      <verse number="14" id="v14">And I will make &lt;i&gt;thee&lt;/i&gt; to pass with thine enemies into a land &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; shall burn upon you.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of hosts.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, &lt;i&gt;and as&lt;/i&gt; waters &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; fail?</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19" newPara="true">Therefore thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.</verse>
