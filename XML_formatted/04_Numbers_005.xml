      <verse number="1" id="v1">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5" newPara="true">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and that person be guilty;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; thereof, and give &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; unto &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; against whom he hath trespassed.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and &lt;i&gt;there be&lt;/i&gt; no witness against her, neither she be taken &lt;i&gt;with the manner&lt;/i&gt;;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; into the water:</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And the priest shall set the woman before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness &lt;i&gt;with another&lt;/i&gt; instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">But if thou hast gone aside &lt;i&gt;to another&lt;/i&gt; instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband:</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make &lt;i&gt;thy&lt;/i&gt; belly to swell, and &lt;i&gt;thy&lt;/i&gt; thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; out with the bitter water:</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, &lt;i&gt;and become&lt;/i&gt; bitter.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and offer it upon the altar:</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; the memorial thereof, and burn &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, &lt;i&gt;and become&lt;/i&gt; bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside &lt;i&gt;to another&lt;/i&gt; instead of her husband, and is defiled;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.</verse>
