      <verse number="1" id="v1">In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Stand in the court of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;, but ye have not hearkened;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had commanded &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s &lt;i&gt;house&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God; and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">As for me, behold, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16" newPara="true">Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts; Zion shall be plowed &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and besought the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, &lt;i&gt;namely&lt;/i&gt;, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and &lt;i&gt;certain&lt;/i&gt; men with him into Egypt.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</verse>
