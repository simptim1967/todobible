      <verse number="1" id="v1">And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this &lt;i&gt;fellow&lt;/i&gt; perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, &lt;woc&gt;Thou sayest &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Then said Pilate to the chief priests and &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; the people, I find no fault in this man.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long &lt;i&gt;season&lt;/i&gt;, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13" newPara="true">And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">I will therefore chastise him, and release &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this &lt;i&gt;man&lt;/i&gt;, and release unto us Barabbas:</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">But they cried, saying, Crucify &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;, crucify him.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; go.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; after Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27" newPara="true">And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">But Jesus turning unto them said, &lt;woc&gt;Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">&lt;woc&gt;For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">&lt;woc&gt;Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">&lt;woc&gt;For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34" newPara="true">Then said Jesus, &lt;woc&gt;Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.&lt;/woc&gt; And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39" newPara="true">And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">And Jesus said unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44">And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46" newPara="true">And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, &lt;woc&gt;Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit:&lt;/woc&gt; and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47">Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</verse>
      <verse number="49" id="v49">And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</verse>
      <verse number="50" id="v50" newPara="true">And, behold, &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; a man named Joseph, a counsellor; &lt;i&gt;and he was&lt;/i&gt; a good man, and a just:</verse>
      <verse number="51" id="v51">(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) &lt;i&gt;he was&lt;/i&gt; of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</verse>
      <verse number="52" id="v52">This &lt;i&gt;man&lt;/i&gt; went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="53" id="v53">And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</verse>
      <verse number="54" id="v54">And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</verse>
      <verse number="55" id="v55">And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</verse>
      <verse number="56" id="v56">And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</verse>
