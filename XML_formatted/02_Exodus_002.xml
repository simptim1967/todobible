      <verse number="1" id="v1">And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took &lt;i&gt;to wife&lt;/i&gt; a daughter of Levi.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he &lt;i&gt;was a&lt;/i&gt; goodly &lt;i&gt;child&lt;/i&gt;, she hid him three months.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; in the flags by the river's brink.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5" newPara="true">And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash &lt;i&gt;herself&lt;/i&gt; at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And when she had opened &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This &lt;i&gt;is one&lt;/i&gt; of the Hebrews' children.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give &lt;i&gt;thee&lt;/i&gt; thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew &lt;i&gt;water&lt;/i&gt;, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How &lt;i&gt;is it that&lt;/i&gt; ye are come so soon to day?</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew &lt;i&gt;water&lt;/i&gt; enough for us, and watered the flock.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And he said unto his daughters, And where &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; he? why &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; it &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And she bare &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23" newPara="true">And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
