      <verse number="3" id="v3">Therefore thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; evil.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">In that day shall &lt;span class="extra"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt; take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</verse>

      <verse number="6" id="v6">Prophesy ye not, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;say they to them that&lt;/span&gt; prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; they shall not take shame.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">O &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thou that art&lt;/span&gt; named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; straitened? &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</verse>

      <verse number="11" id="v11">If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;saying&lt;/span&gt;, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the multitude of&lt;/span&gt; men.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; on the head of them.</verse>
