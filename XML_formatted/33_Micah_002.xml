      <verse number="1" id="v1">Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And they covet fields, and take &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; by violence; and houses, and take &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Therefore thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; evil.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">In that day shall &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Prophesy ye not, &lt;i&gt;say they to them that&lt;/i&gt; prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; they shall not take shame.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">O &lt;i&gt;thou that art&lt;/i&gt; named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; straitened? &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Arise ye, and depart; for this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; not &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, even with a sore destruction.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt;, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of &lt;i&gt;the multitude of&lt;/i&gt; men.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; on the head of them.</verse>
