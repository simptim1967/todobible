      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; unto them.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; at Jerusalem: and with them &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; the prophets of God helping them.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3" newPara="true">At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?</verse>

      <verse number="5" id="v5">But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this &lt;span class="extra"&gt;matter&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>

      <verse number="8" id="v8">Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Then asked we those elders, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; the chief of them.</verse>

      <verse number="13" id="v13">But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the same&lt;/span&gt; king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto &lt;span class="extra"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;, whose name &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Then came the same Sheshbazzar, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; laid the foundation of the house of God which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;yet&lt;/span&gt; it is not finished.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Now therefore, if &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it seem&lt;/span&gt; good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; there at Babylon, whether it be &lt;span class="extra"&gt;so&lt;/span&gt;, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</verse>
