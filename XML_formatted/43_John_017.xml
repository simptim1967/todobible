      <verse number="1" id="v1">These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, &lt;woc&gt;Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">&lt;woc&gt;As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">&lt;woc&gt;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;woc&gt;I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">&lt;woc&gt;And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">&lt;woc&gt;I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;woc&gt;Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;woc&gt;For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">&lt;woc&gt;I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">&lt;woc&gt;And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">&lt;woc&gt;And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">&lt;woc&gt;While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">&lt;woc&gt;And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">&lt;woc&gt;I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">&lt;woc&gt;I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">&lt;woc&gt;They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">&lt;woc&gt;Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;woc&gt;As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">&lt;woc&gt;And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">&lt;woc&gt;Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">&lt;woc&gt;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">&lt;woc&gt;And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">&lt;woc&gt;I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">&lt;woc&gt;Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">&lt;woc&gt;O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">&lt;woc&gt;And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
