      <verse number="1" id="v1">And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the &lt;span class='extra'&gt;other&lt;/span&gt; kine upon the brink of the river.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it was&lt;/span&gt; a dream.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there was&lt;/span&gt; none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;both&lt;/span&gt; me and the chief baker:</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there was&lt;/span&gt; there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved &lt;span class='extra'&gt;himself&lt;/span&gt;, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there is&lt;/span&gt; none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;It is&lt;/span&gt; not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told &lt;span class='extra'&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; unto the magicians; but &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there was&lt;/span&gt; none that could declare &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; to me.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25" newPara="true">And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; about to do.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">The seven good kine &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; seven years; and the seven good ears &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; seven years: the dream &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; one.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">This &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it &lt;span class='extra'&gt;shall be&lt;/span&gt; very grievous.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; because the thing &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">Let Pharaoh do &lt;span class='extra'&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37" newPara="true">And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find &lt;span class='extra'&gt;such a one&lt;/span&gt; as this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;, a man in whom the Spirit of God &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;?</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there is&lt;/span&gt; none so discreet and wise as thou &lt;span class='extra'&gt;art&lt;/span&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him &lt;span class='extra'&gt;ruler&lt;/span&gt; over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I &lt;span class='extra'&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45">And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over &lt;span class='extra'&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; the land of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46" newPara="true">And Joseph &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47">And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; round about every city, laid he up in the same.</verse>
      <verse number="49" id="v49">And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it was&lt;/span&gt; without number.</verse>
      <verse number="50" id="v50">And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.</verse>
      <verse number="51" id="v51">And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;said he&lt;/span&gt;, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.</verse>
      <verse number="52" id="v52">And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</verse>
      <verse number="53" id="v53" newPara="true">And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.</verse>
      <verse number="54" id="v54">And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</verse>
      <verse number="55" id="v55">And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</verse>
      <verse number="56" id="v56">And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse number="57" id="v57">And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy &lt;span class='extra'&gt;corn&lt;/span&gt;; because that the famine was &lt;span class='extra'&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; sore in all lands.</verse>
