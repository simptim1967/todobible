      <verse number="1" id="v1">Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to &lt;span class='extra'&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of &lt;span class='extra'&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; husband.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">So then if, while &lt;span class='extra'&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not &lt;span class='extra'&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; the oldness of the letter.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">What shall we say then? &lt;span class='extra'&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt; the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; dead.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the commandment, which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was ordained&lt;/span&gt; to life, I found &lt;span class='extra'&gt;to be&lt;/span&gt; unto death.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew &lt;span class='extra'&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Wherefore the law &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; good.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but &lt;span class='extra'&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; to perform that which is good I find not.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</verse>
