      <verse number="1" id="v1">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3" newPara="true">And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring &lt;span class='extra'&gt;certain&lt;/span&gt; of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Children in whom &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as &lt;span class='extra'&gt;had&lt;/span&gt; ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel &lt;span class='extra'&gt;the name&lt;/span&gt; of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; of your sort? then shall ye make &lt;span class='extra'&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; endanger my head to the king.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And in all matters of wisdom &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; astrologers that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; in all his realm.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And Daniel continued &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; unto the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
