      <verse number="1" id="v1">Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">The good &lt;i&gt;man&lt;/i&gt; is perished out of the earth: and &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3" newPara="true">That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge &lt;i&gt;asketh&lt;/i&gt; for a reward; and the great &lt;i&gt;man&lt;/i&gt;, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">The best of them &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; as a brier: the most upright &lt;i&gt;is sharper&lt;/i&gt; than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.</verse>

      <verse number="6" id="v6">For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the men of his own house.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Therefore I will look unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; a light unto me.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">I will bear the indignation of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; I shall behold his righteousness.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Then &lt;i&gt;she that is&lt;/i&gt; mine enemy shall see &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">&lt;i&gt;In&lt;/i&gt; the day that thy walls are to be built, &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; that day shall the decree be far removed.</verse>

      <verse number="13" id="v13">Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</verse>

      <verse number="15" id="v15">According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16" newPara="true">The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; hand upon &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; mouth, their ears shall be deaf.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God, and shall fear because of thee.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Who &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; mercy.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</verse>
