      <verse number="1" id="v1">Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">If so be ye have tasted that the Lord &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; gracious.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">To whom coming, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;as unto&lt;/span&gt; a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; precious,</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Unto you therefore which believe &lt;span class='extra'&gt;he is&lt;/span&gt; precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even to them&lt;/span&gt; which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">But ye &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Which in time past &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; not a people, but &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Dearly beloved, I beseech &lt;span class='extra'&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by &lt;span class='extra'&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">As free, and not using &lt;span class='extra'&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Honour all &lt;span class='extra'&gt;men&lt;/span&gt;. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Servants, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; subject to &lt;span class='extra'&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">For this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">For what glory &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is it&lt;/span&gt;, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer &lt;span class='extra'&gt;for it&lt;/span&gt;, ye take it patiently, this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; acceptable with God.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed &lt;span class='extra'&gt;himself&lt;/span&gt; to him that judgeth righteously:</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</verse>
