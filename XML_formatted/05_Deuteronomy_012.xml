      <verse number="6" id="v6">And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And there ye shall eat before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God hath blessed thee.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Ye shall not do after all &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the things&lt;/span&gt; that we do here this day, every man whatsoever &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; right in his own eyes.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God giveth you.</verse>

      <verse number="21" id="v21">If the place which the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; them alike.</verse>

      <verse number="26" id="v26">Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall choose:</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that which is&lt;/span&gt; good and right in the sight of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29" newPara="true">When the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">Thou shalt not do so unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God: for every abomination to the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.</verse>
