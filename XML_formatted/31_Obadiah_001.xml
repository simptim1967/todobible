      <verse number="4" id="v4">Though thou exalt &lt;i&gt;thyself&lt;/i&gt; as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; grapes?</verse>

      <verse number="8" id="v8">Shall I not in that day, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, even destroy the wise &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt; out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?</verse>

      <verse number="12" id="v12">But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid &lt;i&gt;hands&lt;/i&gt; on their substance in the day of their calamity;</verse>
