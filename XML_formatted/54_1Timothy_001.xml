      <verse number="1" id="v1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;which is&lt;/span&gt; our hope;</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Unto Timothy, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: &lt;span class='extra'&gt;so do&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; a good conscience, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; faith unfeigned:</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">But we know that the law &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; good, if a man use it lawfully;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">This &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</verse>
