      <verse number="1" id="v1">And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; upon the top thereof:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And two olive trees by it, one upon the right &lt;span class="extra"&gt;side&lt;/span&gt; of the bowl, and the other upon the left &lt;span class="extra"&gt;side&lt;/span&gt; thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; these, my lord?</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the word of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Who &lt;span class="extra"&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thou shalt become&lt;/span&gt; a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thereof with&lt;/span&gt; shoutings, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;crying&lt;/span&gt;, Grace, grace unto it.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Moreover the word of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; came unto me, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts hath sent me unto you.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel &lt;span class="extra"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; those seven; they &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; the eyes of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">Then answered I, and said unto him, What &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; these two olive trees upon the right &lt;span class="extra"&gt;side&lt;/span&gt; of the candlestick and upon the left &lt;span class="extra"&gt;side&lt;/span&gt; thereof?</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And I answered again, and said unto him, What &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be these&lt;/span&gt; two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden &lt;span class="extra"&gt;oil&lt;/span&gt; out of themselves?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Then said he, These &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</verse>
