      <verse number="1" id="v1">Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">For every man shall bear his own burden.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all &lt;span class="extra"&gt;men&lt;/span&gt;, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And as many as walk according to this rule, peace &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
