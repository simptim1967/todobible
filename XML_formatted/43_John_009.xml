      <verse number="1" id="v1">And as &lt;i&gt;Jesus&lt;/i&gt; passed by, he saw a man which was blind from &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; birth.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Jesus answered, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And said unto him, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,&lt;/span&gt; (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Some said, This is he: others &lt;i&gt;said&lt;/i&gt;, He is like him: &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; he said, I am &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash:&lt;/span&gt; and I went and washed, and I received sight.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13" newPara="true">They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">These &lt;i&gt;words&lt;/i&gt; spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner &lt;i&gt;or no&lt;/i&gt;, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; again? will ye also be his disciples?</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">We know that God spake unto Moses: &lt;i&gt;as for&lt;/i&gt; this &lt;i&gt;fellow&lt;/i&gt;, we know not from whence he is.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; he hath opened mine eyes.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Dost thou believe on the Son of God?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And Jesus said unto him, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39" newPara="true">And Jesus said, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">And &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">Jesus said unto them, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
