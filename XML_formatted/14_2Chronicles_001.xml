      <verse number="11" id="v11">And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Wisdom and knowledge &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;have been&lt;/span&gt; before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</verse>
