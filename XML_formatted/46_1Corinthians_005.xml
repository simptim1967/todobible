      <verse number="1" id="v1">It is reported commonly &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that there is&lt;/span&gt; fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;concerning&lt;/span&gt; him that hath so done this deed,</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Your glorying &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened &lt;span class="extra"&gt;bread&lt;/span&gt; of sincerity and truth.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</verse>
