      <verse number="9" id="v9">Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Thus saith the Lord &lt;span class="nog"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;; It shall also come to pass, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought:</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that are now&lt;/span&gt; inhabited, and upon the people &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that are&lt;/span&gt; gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord &lt;span class="nog"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;?</verse>

      <verse number="17" id="v17">Thus saith the Lord &lt;span class="nog"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class="extra"&gt;Art&lt;/span&gt; thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days &lt;span class="extra"&gt;many&lt;/span&gt; years that I would bring thee against them?</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord &lt;span class="nog"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; my fury shall come up in my face.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">For in my jealousy &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;</verse>

      <verse number="21" id="v21">And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord &lt;span class="nog"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;: every man's sword shall be against his brother.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
