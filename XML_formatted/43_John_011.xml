      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now a certain &lt;i&gt;man&lt;/i&gt; was sick, &lt;i&gt;named&lt;/i&gt; Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">(It was &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">When Jesus heard &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, he said, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Then after that saith he to &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; disciples, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Let us go into Judaea again.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;i&gt;His&lt;/i&gt; disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Jesus answered, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Then said Jesus unto them plainly, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Lazarus is dead.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Then when Jesus came, he found that he had &lt;i&gt;lain&lt;/i&gt; in the grave four days already.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; in the house.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; thee.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Jesus saith unto her, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Thy brother shall rise again.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Jesus said unto her, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">As soon as she heard &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">And said, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Where have ye laid him?&lt;/span&gt; They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">Jesus wept.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">Jesus said, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Take ye away the stone.&lt;/span&gt; Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt; four days.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">Jesus saith unto her, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">Then they took away the stone &lt;i&gt;from the place&lt;/i&gt; where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; eyes, and said, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Lazarus, come forth.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44">And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Loose him, and let him go.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45">Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47" newPara="true">Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">If we let him thus alone, all &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt; will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</verse>
      <verse number="49" id="v49">And one of them, &lt;i&gt;named&lt;/i&gt; Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</verse>
      <verse number="50" id="v50">Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</verse>
      <verse number="51" id="v51">And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</verse>
      <verse number="52" id="v52">And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</verse>
      <verse number="53" id="v53">Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</verse>
      <verse number="54" id="v54">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</verse>
      <verse number="55" id="v55" newPara="true">And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
      <verse number="56" id="v56">Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</verse>
      <verse number="57" id="v57">Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, that they might take him.</verse>
