      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And &lt;i&gt;when they come&lt;/i&gt; from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">He answered and said unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; lips, but their heart is far from me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;woc&gt;Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; doctrines the commandments of men.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;woc&gt;For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And he said unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">&lt;woc&gt;For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">&lt;woc&gt;But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother&lt;i&gt;, It is&lt;/i&gt; Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; &lt;i&gt;he shall be free&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">&lt;woc&gt;And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">&lt;woc&gt;Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">And when he had called all the people &lt;i&gt;unto him&lt;/i&gt;, he said unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Hearken unto me every one &lt;i&gt;of you&lt;/i&gt;, and understand:&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">&lt;woc&gt;There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">&lt;woc&gt;If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And he saith unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; cannot defile him;&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">&lt;woc&gt;Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And he said, &lt;woc&gt;That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">&lt;woc&gt;For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">&lt;woc&gt;Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">&lt;woc&gt;All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24" newPara="true">And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;: but he could not be hid.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">For a &lt;i&gt;certain&lt;/i&gt; woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">But Jesus said unto her, &lt;woc&gt;Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; unto the dogs.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And he said unto her, &lt;woc&gt;For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31" newPara="true">And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Ephphatha,&lt;/woc&gt; that is, &lt;woc&gt;Be opened.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;;</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</verse>
