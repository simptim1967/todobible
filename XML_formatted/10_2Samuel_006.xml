      <verse number="1" id="v1">Again, David gathered together all &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; chosen &lt;span class="extra"&gt;men&lt;/span&gt; of Israel, thirty thousand.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And David arose, and went with all the people that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts that dwelleth &lt;span class="extra"&gt;between&lt;/span&gt; the cherubims.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And David and all the house of Israel played before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; on all manner of &lt;span class="extra"&gt;instruments made of&lt;/span&gt; fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his hand&lt;/span&gt; to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And the anger of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; error; and there he died by the ark of God.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And David was displeased, because the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And David was afraid of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; that day, and said, How shall the ark of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; come to me?</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">So David would not remove the ark of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And the ark of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; blessed Obed-edom, and all his household.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">And it was told king David, saying, The &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;pertaineth&lt;/span&gt; unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And it was &lt;span class="extra"&gt;so&lt;/span&gt;, that when they that bare the ark of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And David danced before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; with all &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; might; and David &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And as the ark of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; and she despised him in her heart.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">And they brought in the ark of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And he dealt among all the people, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of flesh&lt;/span&gt;, and a flagon &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of wine&lt;/span&gt;. So all the people departed every one to his house.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And David said unto Michal, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;It was&lt;/span&gt; before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, over Israel: therefore will I play before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.</verse>
