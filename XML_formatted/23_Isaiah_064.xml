      <verse number="1" id="v1">Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">As &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; the nations may tremble at thy presence!</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">When thou didst terrible things &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For since the beginning of the world &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt; have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, &lt;i&gt;those that&lt;/i&gt; remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">But we are all as an unclean &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;, and all our righteousnesses &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">But now, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, thou &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; our father; we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the clay, and thou our potter; and we all &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the work of thy hand.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">Be not wroth very sore, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; all thy people.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Wilt thou refrain thyself for these &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt;, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?</verse>
