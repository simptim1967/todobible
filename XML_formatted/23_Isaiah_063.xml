      <verse number="1" id="v1">Who &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this &lt;i&gt;that is&lt;/i&gt; glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Wherefore &lt;i&gt;art thou&lt;/i&gt; red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For the day of vengeance &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And I looked, and &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; none to help; and I wondered that &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.</verse>

      <verse number="8" id="v8">For he said, Surely they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; my people, children &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; will not lie: so he was their Saviour.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; he fought against them.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; his people, &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt;, Where &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; he that put his holy Spirit within him?</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">That led &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; they should not stumble?</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Doubtless thou &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; our father, our redeemer; thy name &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; from everlasting.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">The people of thy holiness have possessed &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">We are &lt;i&gt;thine&lt;/i&gt;: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.</verse>
