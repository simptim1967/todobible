      <verse number="1" id="v1">Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Then said he unto me, Son of man, these &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Which say, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;It is&lt;/span&gt; not near; let us build houses: this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;city is&lt;/span&gt; the caldron, and we &lt;span class='extra'&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; the flesh.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the Spirit of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;every one of&lt;/span&gt; them.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Therefore thus saith the Lord &lt;span class='nog'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; the flesh, and this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;city is&lt;/span&gt; the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord &lt;span class='nog'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I &lt;span class='extra'&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">This &lt;span class='extra'&gt;city&lt;/span&gt; shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; &lt;span class='extra'&gt;but&lt;/span&gt; I will judge you in the border of Israel:</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And ye shall know that I &lt;span class='extra'&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; round about you.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13" newPara="true">And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord &lt;span class='nog'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Again the word of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; came unto me, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Son of man, thy brethren, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: unto us is this land given in possession.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord &lt;span class='nog'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord &lt;span class='nog'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">But &lt;span class='extra'&gt;as for them&lt;/span&gt; whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord &lt;span class='nog'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22" newPara="true">Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; over them above.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And the glory of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; on the east side of the city.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24" newPara="true">Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had shewed me.</verse>
