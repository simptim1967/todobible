      <verse number="2" id="v2">&lt;i&gt;As&lt;/i&gt; God liveth, &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; hath vexed my soul;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">All the while my breath &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in me, and the spirit of God &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in my nostrils;</verse>

      <verse number="7" id="v7">Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">For what &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">I will teach you by the hand of God: &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; with the Almighty will I not conceal.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Behold, all ye yourselves have seen &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;; why then are ye thus altogether vain?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; they shall receive of the Almighty.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">If his children be multiplied, &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt; for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</verse>

      <verse number="18" id="v18">He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; the keeper maketh.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; not.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">For &lt;i&gt;God&lt;/i&gt; shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">&lt;i&gt;Men&lt;/i&gt; shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.</verse>
