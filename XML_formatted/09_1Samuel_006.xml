      <verse number="1" id="v1">And the ark of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was in the country of the Philistines seven months.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Then said they, What &lt;span class='extra'&gt;shall be&lt;/span&gt; the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;according to&lt;/span&gt; the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; on you all, and on your lords.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?</verse>

      <verse number="9" id="v9">And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; not his hand &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; smote us: it &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; a chance &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; happened to us.</verse>

      <verse number="13" id="v13">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;they of&lt;/span&gt; Beth-shemesh &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there was&lt;/span&gt; a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And the Levites took down the ark of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and the coffer that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; with it, wherein the jewels of gold &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt;, and put &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
