      <verse number="1" id="v1">And when he had called unto &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; his twelve disciples, he gave them power &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James &lt;i&gt;the son&lt;/i&gt; of Zebedee, and John his brother;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James &lt;i&gt;the son&lt;/i&gt; of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; city of the Samaritans enter ye not:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Nor scrip for &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And when ye come into an house, salute it.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16" newPara="true">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; parents, and cause them to be put to death.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And ye shall be hated of all &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt; for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;The disciple is not above &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; master, nor the servant above his lord.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more &lt;i&gt;shall they call&lt;/i&gt; them of his household?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;What I tell you in darkness, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; preach ye upon the housetops.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And a man's foes &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; they of his own household.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40" newPara="true">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold &lt;i&gt;water&lt;/i&gt; only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
