      <verse number="1" id="v1">Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because &lt;span class='extra'&gt;they are&lt;/span&gt; many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;!</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Yet he also &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Now the Egyptians &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For thus hath the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;he&lt;/span&gt; will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">As birds flying, so will the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it; and&lt;/span&gt; passing over he will preserve &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">Turn ye unto &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him from&lt;/span&gt; whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you &lt;span class='extra'&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; a sin.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, whose fire &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.</verse>
