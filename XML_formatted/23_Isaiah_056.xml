      <verse number="1" id="v1">Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Blessed &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the man &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; doeth this, and the son of man &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3" newPara="true">Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, speak, saying, The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; a dry tree.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose &lt;i&gt;the things&lt;/i&gt; that please me, and take hold of my covenant;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, to serve him, and to love the name of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">The Lord &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt; which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather &lt;i&gt;others&lt;/i&gt; to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, &lt;i&gt;yea&lt;/i&gt;, all ye beasts in the forest.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">His watchmen &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; blind: they are all ignorant, they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Yea, &lt;i&gt;they are&lt;/i&gt; greedy dogs &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; can never have enough, and they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; shepherds &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Come ye, &lt;i&gt;say they&lt;/i&gt;, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; much more abundant.</verse>
