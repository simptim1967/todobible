      <verse number="7" id="v7">Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And the priests consented to receive no &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money &lt;i&gt;that was&lt;/i&gt; brought into the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And it was &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt;, when they saw that &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;,</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Howbeit there were not made for the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money &lt;i&gt;that was&lt;/i&gt; brought into the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: it was the priests'.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>

      <verse number="19" id="v19" newPara="true">And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</verse>
