      <verse number="1" id="v1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">&lt;woc&gt;Ye know that after two days is &lt;i&gt;the feast of&lt;/i&gt; the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">But they said, Not on the feast &lt;i&gt;day&lt;/i&gt;, lest there be an uproar among the people.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat &lt;i&gt;at meat&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">But when his disciples saw &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; this waste?</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">When Jesus understood &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, he said unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">&lt;woc&gt;For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">&lt;woc&gt;For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; for my burial.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">&lt;woc&gt;Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt; shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And said &lt;i&gt;unto them&lt;/i&gt;, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">Now the first &lt;i&gt;day&lt;/i&gt; of the &lt;i&gt;feast of&lt;/i&gt; unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And he said, &lt;woc&gt;Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And as they did eat, he said, &lt;woc&gt;Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And he answered and said, &lt;woc&gt;He that dippeth &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">&lt;woc&gt;The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Thou hast said.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26" newPara="true">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, and brake &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, and gave &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; to the disciples, and said, &lt;woc&gt;Take, eat; this is my body.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; to them, saying, &lt;woc&gt;Drink ye all of it;&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">&lt;woc&gt;For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">&lt;woc&gt;But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">Then saith Jesus unto them, &lt;woc&gt;All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">&lt;woc&gt;But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">Peter answered and said unto him, Though all &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt; shall be offended because of thee, &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; will I never be offended.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">Jesus said unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36" newPara="true">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, &lt;woc&gt;Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">Then saith he unto them, &lt;woc&gt;My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, &lt;woc&gt;O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou &lt;i&gt;wilt&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, &lt;woc&gt;What, could ye not watch with me one hour?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">&lt;woc&gt;Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; willing, but the flesh &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; weak.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, &lt;woc&gt;O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Sleep on now, and take &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">&lt;woc&gt;Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47" newPara="true">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</verse>
      <verse number="49" id="v49">And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</verse>
      <verse number="50" id="v50">And Jesus said unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Friend, wherefore art thou come?&lt;/woc&gt; Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</verse>
      <verse number="51" id="v51">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</verse>
      <verse number="52" id="v52">Then said Jesus unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="53" id="v53">&lt;woc&gt;Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="54" id="v54">&lt;woc&gt;But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="55" id="v55">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, &lt;woc&gt;Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="56" id="v56">&lt;woc&gt;But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&lt;/woc&gt; Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</verse>
      <verse number="57" id="v57" newPara="true">And they that had laid hold on Jesus led &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</verse>
      <verse number="58" id="v58">But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</verse>
      <verse number="59" id="v59">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</verse>
      <verse number="60" id="v60">But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</verse>
      <verse number="61" id="v61">And said, This &lt;i&gt;fellow&lt;/i&gt; said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</verse>
      <verse number="62" id="v62">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what &lt;i&gt;is it which&lt;/i&gt; these witness against thee?</verse>
      <verse number="63" id="v63">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
      <verse number="64" id="v64">Jesus saith unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="65" id="v65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
      <verse number="66" id="v66">What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</verse>
      <verse number="67" id="v67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; with the palms of their hands,</verse>
      <verse number="68" id="v68">Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</verse>
      <verse number="69" id="v69" newPara="true">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</verse>
      <verse number="70" id="v70">But he denied before &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</verse>
      <verse number="71" id="v71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another &lt;i&gt;maid&lt;/i&gt; saw him, and said unto them that were there, This &lt;i&gt;fellow&lt;/i&gt; was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
      <verse number="72" id="v72">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</verse>
      <verse number="73" id="v73">And after a while came unto &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</verse>
      <verse number="74" id="v74">Then began he to curse and to swear, &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt;, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</verse>
      <verse number="75" id="v75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.&lt;/woc&gt; And he went out, and wept bitterly.</verse>
