      <verse number="1" id="v1">And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</verse>

      <verse number="8" id="v8">And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</verse>

      <verse number="12" id="v12">Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</verse>
