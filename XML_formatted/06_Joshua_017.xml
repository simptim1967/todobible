      <verse number="1" id="v1">There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the firstborn of Joseph; &lt;i&gt;to wit&lt;/i&gt;, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">There was also &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abi-ezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3" newPara="true">But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; on the other side Jordan;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that &lt;i&gt;lieth&lt;/i&gt; before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt; Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh &lt;i&gt;belonged&lt;/i&gt; to the children of Ephraim;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Southward &lt;i&gt;it was&lt;/i&gt; Ephraim's, and northward &lt;i&gt;it was&lt;/i&gt; Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; three countries.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out &lt;i&gt;the inhabitants of&lt;/i&gt; those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; a great people, forasmuch as the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath blessed me hitherto?</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And Joshua answered them, If thou &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a great people, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; get thee up to the wood &lt;i&gt;country&lt;/i&gt;, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, &lt;i&gt;both they&lt;/i&gt; who &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; of Beth-shean and her towns, and &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; who &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; of the valley of Jezreel.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">But the mountain shall be thine; for it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; though they &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; strong.</verse>
