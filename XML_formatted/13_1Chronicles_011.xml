      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; thy bone and thy flesh.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou &lt;span class="extra"&gt;wast&lt;/span&gt; he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; by Samuel.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; Jebus; where the Jebusites &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt;, the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the city of David.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">So David waxed greater and greater: for the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; with him.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">These also &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; concerning Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And this &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain &lt;span class="extra"&gt;by him&lt;/span&gt; at one time.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And after him &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was one&lt;/span&gt; of the three mighties.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And they set themselves in the midst of &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; saved &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; by a great deliverance.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And David &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; then at Beth-lehem.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; at the gate!</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; by the gate, and took &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, and brought &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; to David: but David would not drink &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; it, but poured it out to the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;,</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the jeopardy of&lt;/span&gt; their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;, and had a name among the three.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the &lt;span class="extra"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; three.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And he slew an Egyptian, a man of &lt;span class="extra"&gt;great&lt;/span&gt; stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">These &lt;span class="extra"&gt;things&lt;/span&gt; did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.</verse>
