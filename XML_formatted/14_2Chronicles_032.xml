      <verse number="1" id="v1">After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; without the city: and they did help him.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo &lt;span class='extra'&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; with him: for &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there be&lt;/span&gt; more with us than with him:</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">With him &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; an arm of flesh; but with us &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he &lt;span class='extra'&gt;himself laid siege&lt;/span&gt; against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; at Jerusalem, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of &lt;span class='extra'&gt;other&lt;/span&gt; lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Who &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was there&lt;/span&gt; among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And his servants spake yet &lt;span class='extra'&gt;more&lt;/span&gt; against the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">He wrote also letters to rail on the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of &lt;span class='extra'&gt;other&lt;/span&gt; lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;which were&lt;/span&gt; the work of the hands of man.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And for this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;cause&lt;/span&gt; Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21" newPara="true">And the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Thus the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all &lt;span class='extra'&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;, and guided them on every side.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And many brought gifts unto the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24" newPara="true">In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit &lt;span class='extra'&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;both&lt;/span&gt; he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27" newPara="true">And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31" newPara="true">Howbeit in &lt;span class='extra'&gt;the business of&lt;/span&gt; the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was &lt;span class='extra'&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that was&lt;/span&gt; in his heart.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32" newPara="true">Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
