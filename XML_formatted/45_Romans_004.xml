      <verse number="1" id="v1">What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath &lt;i&gt;whereof&lt;/i&gt; to glory; but not before God.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;i&gt;Saying&lt;/i&gt;, Blessed &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Blessed &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">&lt;i&gt;Cometh&lt;/i&gt; this blessedness then upon the circumcision &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt;, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which &lt;i&gt;he had yet&lt;/i&gt; being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which &lt;i&gt;he had&lt;/i&gt; being &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; uncircumcised.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">For if they which are of the law &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; no transgression.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Therefore &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt; of faith, that &lt;i&gt;it might be&lt;/i&gt; by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</verse>
