      <verse number="1" id="v1">When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And he must needs go through Samaria.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; journey, sat thus on the well: &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; it was about the sixth hour.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, &lt;woc&gt;Give me to drink.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Jesus answered and said unto her, &lt;woc&gt;If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Jesus answered and said unto her, &lt;woc&gt;Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">&lt;woc&gt;But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Jesus saith unto her, &lt;woc&gt;Go, call thy husband, and come hither.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, &lt;woc&gt;Thou hast well said, I have no husband:&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;woc&gt;For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Jesus saith unto her, &lt;woc&gt;Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">&lt;woc&gt;Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">&lt;woc&gt;But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">&lt;woc&gt;God &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; in spirit and in truth.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">Jesus saith unto her, &lt;woc&gt;I that speak unto thee am &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27" newPara="true">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31" newPara="true">In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">But he said unto them, &lt;woc&gt;I have meat to eat that ye know not of.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; to eat?</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">Jesus saith unto them, &lt;woc&gt;My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">&lt;woc&gt;Say not ye, There are yet four months, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">&lt;woc&gt;And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">&lt;woc&gt;And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">&lt;woc&gt;I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39" newPara="true">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">And many more believed because of his own word;</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43" newPara="true">Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">Then said Jesus unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="49" id="v49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</verse>
      <verse number="50" id="v50">Jesus saith unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Go thy way; thy son liveth.&lt;/woc&gt; And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</verse>
      <verse number="51" id="v51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;, saying, Thy son liveth.</verse>
      <verse number="52" id="v52">Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
      <verse number="53" id="v53">So the father knew that &lt;i&gt;it was&lt;/i&gt; at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Thy son liveth:&lt;/woc&gt; and himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
      <verse number="54" id="v54">This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; again the second miracle &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</verse>
