      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;belongeth&lt;/span&gt; to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there was&lt;/span&gt; a valley between them.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; six cubits and a span.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;he had&lt;/span&gt; an helmet of brass upon his head, and he &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; five thousand shekels of brass.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;he had&lt;/span&gt; greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And the staff of his spear &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head &lt;span class='extra'&gt;weighed&lt;/span&gt; six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set &lt;span class='extra'&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; battle in array? &lt;span class='extra'&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.</verse>

      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">Now David &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men &lt;span class='extra'&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; an old man in the days of Saul.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And the three eldest sons of Jesse went &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And David &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched &lt;span class='extra'&gt;corn&lt;/span&gt;, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of &lt;span class='extra'&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28" newPara="true">And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And David said, What have I now done? &lt;span class='extra'&gt;Is there&lt;/span&gt; not a cause?</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30" newPara="true">And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; before Saul: and he sent for him.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32" newPara="true">And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou &lt;span class='extra'&gt;art but&lt;/span&gt; a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">David said moreover, The &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; be with thee.</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38" newPara="true">And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;. And David put them off him.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield &lt;span class='extra'&gt;went&lt;/span&gt; before him.</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was &lt;span class='extra'&gt;but&lt;/span&gt; a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">And the Philistine said unto David, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;Am&lt;/span&gt; I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44">And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45">Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">This day will the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47">And all this assembly shall know that the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s, and he will give you into our hands.</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</verse>
      <verse number="49" id="v49">And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.</verse>
      <verse number="50" id="v50">So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there was&lt;/span&gt; no sword in the hand of David.</verse>
      <verse number="51" id="v51">Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.</verse>
      <verse number="52" id="v52">And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.</verse>
      <verse number="53" id="v53">And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</verse>
      <verse number="54" id="v54">And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.</verse>
      <verse number="55" id="v55" newPara="true">And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; this youth? And Abner said, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.</verse>
      <verse number="56" id="v56">And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="57" id="v57">And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</verse>
      <verse number="58" id="v58">And Saul said to him, Whose son &lt;span class='extra'&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; thou, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;thou&lt;/span&gt; young man? And David answered, I &lt;span class='extra'&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.</verse>
