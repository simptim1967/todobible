      <verse number="5" id="v5">His glory &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</verse>

      <verse number="12" id="v12">Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; thou shalt make ready &lt;span class='extra'&gt;thine arrows&lt;/span&gt; upon thy strings against the face of them.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Be thou exalted, &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, in thine own strength: &lt;span class='extra'&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; will we sing and praise thy power.</verse>
