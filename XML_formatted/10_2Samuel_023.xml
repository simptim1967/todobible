      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now these &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man &lt;i&gt;who was&lt;/i&gt; raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">The Spirit of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake by me, and his word &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; in my tongue.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men &lt;i&gt;must be&lt;/i&gt; just, ruling in the fear of God.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And &lt;i&gt;he shall be&lt;/i&gt; as the light of the morning, &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; the sun riseth, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; a morning without clouds; &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; the tender grass &lt;i&gt;springing&lt;/i&gt; out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Although my house &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt;, and sure: for &lt;i&gt;this is&lt;/i&gt; all my salvation, and all &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; desire, although he make &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; not to grow.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">But &lt;i&gt;the sons&lt;/i&gt; of Belial &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">But the man &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the &lt;i&gt;same&lt;/i&gt; place.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">These &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Adino the Eznite: &lt;i&gt;he lift up his spear&lt;/i&gt; against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And after him &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And after him &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; wrought a great victory.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And David &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; then &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; Beth-lehem.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; by the gate!</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; by the gate, and took &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, and brought &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And he said, Be it far from me, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, that I should do this: &lt;i&gt;is not this&lt;/i&gt; the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; slew &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;, and had the name among three.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; three.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">These &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; three. And David set him over his guard.</verse>
