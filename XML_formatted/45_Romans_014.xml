      <verse number="1" id="v1">Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; not to doubtful disputations.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day &lt;i&gt;alike&lt;/i&gt;. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">He that regardeth the day, regardeth &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">For it is written, &lt;i&gt;As&lt;/i&gt; I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; brother's way.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt; unclean.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">But if thy brother be grieved with &lt;i&gt;thy&lt;/i&gt; meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">For he that in these things serveth Christ &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; acceptable to God, and approved of men.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; pure; but &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt; evil for that man who eateth with offence.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">&lt;i&gt;It is&lt;/i&gt; good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor &lt;i&gt;any thing&lt;/i&gt; whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Hast thou faith? have &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; to thyself before God. Happy &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because &lt;i&gt;he eateth&lt;/i&gt; not of faith: for whatsoever &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; not of faith is sin.</verse>
