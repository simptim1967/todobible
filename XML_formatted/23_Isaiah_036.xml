      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And the king of Assyria sent Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; this wherein thou trustest?</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">I say, &lt;i&gt;sayest thou&lt;/i&gt;, (but &lt;i&gt;they are but&lt;/i&gt; vain words) &lt;i&gt;I have&lt;/i&gt; counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">But if thou say to me, We trust in the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God: &lt;i&gt;is it&lt;/i&gt; not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And am I now come up without the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; against this land to destroy it? the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; on the wall.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">But Rab-shakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? &lt;i&gt;hath he&lt;/i&gt; not &lt;i&gt;sent me&lt;/i&gt; to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Then Rab-shakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, saying, The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make &lt;i&gt;an agreement&lt;/i&gt; with me &lt;i&gt;by&lt;/i&gt; a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;i&gt;Beware&lt;/i&gt; lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Where &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Who &lt;i&gt;are they&lt;/i&gt; among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22" newPara="true">Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.</verse>
