      <verse number="1" id="v1">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy &lt;span class="extra"&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And to &lt;span class="extra"&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Yet for love's sake I rather beseech &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thee&lt;/span&gt;, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thee&lt;/span&gt; ought, put that on mine account;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">I Paul have written &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; with mine own hand, I will repay &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
