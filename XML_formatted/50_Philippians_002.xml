      <verse number="1" id="v1">If &lt;i&gt;there be&lt;/i&gt; therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; of one accord, of one mind.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">&lt;i&gt;Let&lt;/i&gt; nothing &lt;i&gt;be done&lt;/i&gt; through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; in heaven, and &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; in earth, and &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; under the earth;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; good pleasure.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</verse>
