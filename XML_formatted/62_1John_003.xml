      <verse number="1" id="v1">Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</verse>

      <verse number="10" id="v10">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Not as Cain, &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; brother abideth in death.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Hereby perceive we the love &lt;i&gt;of God&lt;/i&gt;, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; lives for the brethren.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels &lt;i&gt;of compassion&lt;/i&gt; from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; have we confidence toward God.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</verse>
