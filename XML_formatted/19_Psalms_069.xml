      <verse number="4" id="v4">They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; which I took not away.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</verse>

      <verse number="8" id="v8">I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">When I wept, &lt;i&gt;and chastened&lt;/i&gt; my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the song of the drunkards.</verse>

      <verse number="19" id="v19">Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; all before thee.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked &lt;i&gt;for some&lt;/i&gt; to take pity, but &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; none; and for comforters, but I found none.</verse>

      <verse number="30" id="v30">I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">&lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; also shall please the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; better than an ox &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</verse>
