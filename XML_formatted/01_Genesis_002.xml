      <verse number="5" id="v5">And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; not a man to till the ground.</verse>

      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the gold of that land &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; good: there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; bdellium and the onyx stone.</verse>

      <verse number="16" id="v16">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God said, &lt;i&gt;It is&lt;/i&gt; not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And out of the ground the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the name thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</verse>

      <verse number="23" id="v23">And Adam said, This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
