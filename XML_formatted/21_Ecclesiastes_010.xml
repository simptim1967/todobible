      <verse number="10" id="v10">If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; profitable to direct.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">The words of a wise man's mouth &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">The beginning of the words of his mouth &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; foolishness: and the end of his talk &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; mischievous madness.</verse>

      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19" newPara="true">A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
