      <verse number="5" id="v5">For thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Alas! for that day &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; great, so that none &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; like it: it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">But they shall serve the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; afraid.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">For I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; with thee, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">For thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, Thy bruise &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; incurable, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; thy wound &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; grievous.</verse>

      <verse number="15" id="v15">Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; because they called thee an Outcast, &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt;, This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</verse>

      <verse number="21" id="v21">And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Behold, the whirlwind of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">The fierce anger of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall not return, until he have done &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.</verse>
