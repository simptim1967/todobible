      <verse number="8" id="v8">For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</verse>

      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; afraid.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">For I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; with thee, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</verse>

      <verse number="15" id="v15">Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: &lt;span class="extra"&gt;because&lt;/span&gt; thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; because they called thee an Outcast, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;saying&lt;/span&gt;, This &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</verse>

      <verse number="22" id="v22">And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Behold, the whirlwind of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</verse>
