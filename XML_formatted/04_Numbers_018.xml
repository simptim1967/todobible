      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">This shall be thine of the most holy things, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;reserved&lt;/span&gt; from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;shall be&lt;/span&gt; most holy for thee and for thy sons.</verse>

      <verse number="16" id="v16">And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; twenty gerahs.</verse>

      <verse number="19" id="v19">All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a covenant of salt for ever before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; unto thee and to thy seed with thee.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>

      <verse number="24" id="v24">But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer &lt;span class="extra"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; an heave offering unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25" newPara="true">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; a tenth &lt;span class="extra"&gt;part&lt;/span&gt; of the tithe.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And &lt;span class="extra"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it were&lt;/span&gt; the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s heave offering to Aaron the priest.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, of all the best thereof, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the hallowed part thereof out of it.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.</verse>
