      <verse number="2" id="v2">To Timothy, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">I thank God, whom I serve from &lt;span class='extra'&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Who hath saved us, and called &lt;span class='extra'&gt;us&lt;/span&gt; with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found &lt;span class='extra'&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</verse>
