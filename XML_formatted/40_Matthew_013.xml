      <verse number="1" id="v1">The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Behold, a sower went forth to sow;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And when he sowed, some &lt;span class="extra"&gt;seeds&lt;/span&gt; fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">He answered and said unto them, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;For this people's heart is waxed gross, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with &lt;span class="extra"&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; eyes, and hear with &lt;span class="extra"&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; ears, and should understand with &lt;span class="extra"&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But blessed &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous &lt;span class="extra"&gt;men&lt;/span&gt; have desired to see &lt;span class="extra"&gt;those things&lt;/span&gt; which ye see, and have not seen &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;; and to hear &lt;span class="extra"&gt;those things&lt;/span&gt; which ye hear, and have not heard &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; not, then cometh the wicked &lt;span class="extra"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24" newPara="true">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31" newPara="true">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33" newPara="true">Another parable spake he unto them; &lt;span class="woc"&gt;The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">He answered and said unto them, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked &lt;span class="extra"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44" newPara="true">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45" newPara="true">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47" newPara="true">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="49" id="v49">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="50" id="v50">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="51" id="v51">Jesus saith unto them, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Have ye understood all these things?&lt;/span&gt; They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</verse>
      <verse number="52" id="v52">Then said he unto them, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Therefore every scribe &lt;span class="extra"&gt;which is&lt;/span&gt; instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that is&lt;/span&gt; an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure &lt;span class="extra"&gt;things&lt;/span&gt; new and old.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="53" id="v53" newPara="true">And it came to pass, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</verse>
      <verse number="54" id="v54">And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this &lt;span class="extra"&gt;man&lt;/span&gt; this wisdom, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;these&lt;/span&gt; mighty works?</verse>
      <verse number="55" id="v55">Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</verse>
      <verse number="56" id="v56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this &lt;span class="extra"&gt;man&lt;/span&gt; all these things?</verse>
      <verse number="57" id="v57">And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="58" id="v58">And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</verse>
