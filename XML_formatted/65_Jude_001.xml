      <verse number="2" id="v2">Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Likewise also these &lt;i&gt;filthy&lt;/i&gt; dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds &lt;i&gt;they are&lt;/i&gt; without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard &lt;i&gt;speeches&lt;/i&gt; which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling &lt;i&gt;words&lt;/i&gt;, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And of some have compassion, making a difference:</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And others save with fear, pulling &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">To the only wise God our Saviour, &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</verse>
