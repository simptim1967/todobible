      <verse number="1" id="v1">O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if &lt;i&gt;it be&lt;/i&gt; yet in vain.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, &lt;i&gt;doeth he it&lt;/i&gt; by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt;, In thee shall all nations be blessed.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt; evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; every one that hangeth on a tree:</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though &lt;i&gt;it be&lt;/i&gt; but a man's covenant, yet &lt;i&gt;if it be&lt;/i&gt; confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And this I say, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">For if the inheritance &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; of the law, &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt; no more of promise: but God gave &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; to Abraham by promise.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Wherefore then &lt;i&gt;serveth&lt;/i&gt; the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; &lt;i&gt;and it was&lt;/i&gt; ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Now a mediator is not &lt;i&gt;a mediator&lt;/i&gt; of one, but God is one.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">&lt;i&gt;Is&lt;/i&gt; the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster &lt;i&gt;to bring us&lt;/i&gt; unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And if ye &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
