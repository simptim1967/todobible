      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now these &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; more and mightier than we:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; get them up out of the land.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; with rigour.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; upon the stools; if it &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a daughter, then she shall live.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; not as the Egyptian women; for they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</verse>
