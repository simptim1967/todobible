      <verse number="1" id="v1">I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.</verse>

      <verse number="6" id="v6">&lt;span class='extra'&gt;It is&lt;/span&gt; he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; his name.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;span class='extra'&gt;Are&lt;/span&gt; ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.

      <verse number="9" id="v9">For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as &lt;span class='extra'&gt;corn&lt;/span&gt; is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.</verse>
