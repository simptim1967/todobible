      <verse number="6" id="v6">And in the day of the new moon &lt;i&gt;it shall be&lt;/i&gt; a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">But when the people of the land shall come before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; shall shut the gate.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; a continual burnt offering.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16" newPara="true">Thus saith the Lord &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; their possession by inheritance.</verse>

      <verse number="19" id="v19" newPara="true">After he brought me through the entry, which &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a place on the two sides westward.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Then said he unto me, This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; a court.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">In the four corners of the court &lt;i&gt;there were&lt;/i&gt; courts joined of forty &lt;i&gt;cubits&lt;/i&gt; long and thirty broad: these four corners &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; of one measure.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; a row &lt;i&gt;of building&lt;/i&gt; round about in them, round about them four, and &lt;i&gt;it was&lt;/i&gt; made with boiling places under the rows round about.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Then said he unto me, These &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.</verse>
