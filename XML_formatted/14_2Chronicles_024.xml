      <verse number="1" id="v1">Joash &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; Zibiah of Beer-sheba.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And Joash did &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that which was&lt;/span&gt; right in the sight of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">And it came to pass after this, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; Joash was minded to repair the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; not.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;according to the commandment&lt;/span&gt; of Moses the servant of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; did they bestow upon Baalim.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; the collection &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; Moses the servant of God &lt;span class="extra"&gt;laid&lt;/span&gt; upon Israel in the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;there was&lt;/span&gt; much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And when they had finished &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; vessels to minister, and to offer &lt;span class="extra"&gt;withal&lt;/span&gt;, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; continually all the days of Jehoiada.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was he&lt;/span&gt; when he died.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And they left the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, he hath also forsaken you.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; look upon &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, and require &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23" newPara="true">And it came to pass at the end of the year, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27" newPara="true">Now &lt;span class="extra"&gt;concerning&lt;/span&gt; his sons, and the greatness of the burdens &lt;span class="extra"&gt;laid&lt;/span&gt; upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
