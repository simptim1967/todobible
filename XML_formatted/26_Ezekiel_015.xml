      <verse number="2" id="v2">Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, &lt;i&gt;or than&lt;/i&gt; a branch which is among the trees of the forest?</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt; take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; work?</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?</verse>
