      <verse number="16" id="v16">And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Then he said, What title &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; that that I see? And the men of the city told him, &lt;i&gt;It is&lt;/i&gt; the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.</verse>

      <verse number="22" id="v22">Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, &lt;i&gt;wherein&lt;/i&gt; this passover was holden to the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; in Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24" newPara="true">Moreover the &lt;i&gt;workers with&lt;/i&gt; familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; like him.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26" newPara="true">Notwithstanding the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</verse>

      <verse number="32" id="v32">And he did &lt;i&gt;that which was&lt;/i&gt; evil in the sight of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, according to all that his fathers had done.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</verse>
