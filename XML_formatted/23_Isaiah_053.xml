      <verse number="1" id="v1">Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; revealed?</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there is&lt;/span&gt; no beauty that we should desire him.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were &lt;span class='extra'&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">But he &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; wounded for our transgressions, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;he was&lt;/span&gt; bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was any&lt;/span&gt; deceit in his mouth.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">Yet it pleased the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; to bruise him; he hath put &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see &lt;span class='extra'&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; seed, he shall prolong &lt;span class='extra'&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; days, and the pleasure of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall prosper in his hand.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">He shall see of the travail of his soul, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Therefore will I divide him &lt;span class='extra'&gt;a portion&lt;/span&gt; with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</verse>
