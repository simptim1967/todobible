      <verse number="1" id="v1">And &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of them prisoners.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And Israel vowed a vow unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</verse>

      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; no bread, neither &lt;i&gt;is there any&lt;/i&gt; water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</verse>

      <verse number="9" id="v9">And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</verse>

      <verse number="11" id="v11">And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; before Moab, toward the sunrising.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.</verse>

      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by &lt;i&gt;the direction of&lt;/i&gt; the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness &lt;i&gt;they went&lt;/i&gt; to Mattanah:</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And from Bamoth &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; the valley, that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21" newPara="true">And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; the waters of the well: &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; we will go along by the king's &lt;i&gt;high&lt;/i&gt; way, until we be past thy borders.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; strong.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">For Heshbon &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the lords of the high places of Arnon.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which &lt;i&gt;reacheth&lt;/i&gt; unto Medeba.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31" newPara="true">Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; there.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33" newPara="true">And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</verse>
