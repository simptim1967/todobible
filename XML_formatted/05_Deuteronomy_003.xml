      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">So the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">All these cities &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">(&lt;span class='extra'&gt;Which&lt;/span&gt; Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; a bedstead of iron; &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And this land, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;which&lt;/span&gt; we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;being&lt;/span&gt; the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;which is&lt;/span&gt; the border of the children of Ammon;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast &lt;span class='extra'&gt;thereof&lt;/span&gt;, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">And I commanded you at that time, saying, The &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that are&lt;/span&gt; meet for the war.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (&lt;span class='extra'&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Until the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;until&lt;/span&gt; they also possess the land which the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21" newPara="true">And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Ye shall not fear them: for the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God he shall fight for you.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And I besought the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; at that time, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">O Lord &lt;span class='nog'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is there&lt;/span&gt; in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">But the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.</verse>
