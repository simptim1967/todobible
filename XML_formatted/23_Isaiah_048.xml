      <verse number="2" id="v2">For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; his name.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; suddenly, and they came to pass.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Because I knew that thou &lt;span class="extra"&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; obstinate, and thy neck &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">I have even from the beginning declared &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; to thee; before it came to pass I shewed &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.</verse>

      <verse number="15" id="v15">I, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16" newPara="true">Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; I: and now the Lord &lt;span class="nog"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;, and his Spirit, hath sent me.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; thou shouldest go.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</verse>

      <verse number="21" id="v21">And they thirsted not &lt;span class="extra"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;There is&lt;/span&gt; no peace, saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, unto the wicked.</verse>
