      <verse number="12" id="v12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him that had&lt;/span&gt; none to help him.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</verse>

      <verse number="17" id="v17">And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply &lt;span class='extra'&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; days as the sand.</verse>

      <verse number="21" id="v21">Unto me &lt;span class='extra'&gt;men&lt;/span&gt; gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide &lt;span class='extra'&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; for the latter rain.</verse>
