      <verse number="1" id="v1">Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And this will we do, if God permit.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; to an open shame.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">But that which beareth thorns and briers &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; rejected, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; nigh unto cursing; whose end &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; to be burned.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">For God &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; to them an end of all strife.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; by an oath:</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">That by two immutable things, in which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it was&lt;/span&gt; impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;hope&lt;/span&gt; we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Whither the forerunner is for us entered, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
