      <verse number="1" id="v1">And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; a certain orator &lt;span class="extra"&gt;named&lt;/span&gt; Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt;, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">We accept &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">For we have found this man &lt;span class="extra"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; pestilent &lt;span class="extra"&gt;fellow&lt;/span&gt;, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">But the chief captain Lysias came &lt;span class="extra"&gt;upon us&lt;/span&gt;, and with great violence took &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; away out of our hands,</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;toward&lt;/span&gt; men.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Or else let these same &lt;span class="extra"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt; say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</verse>
