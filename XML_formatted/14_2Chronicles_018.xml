      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And after &lt;i&gt;certain&lt;/i&gt; years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that &lt;i&gt;he had&lt;/i&gt; with him, and persuaded him to go up &lt;i&gt;with him&lt;/i&gt; to Ramoth-gilead.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; as thou &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt;, and my people as thy people; and &lt;i&gt;we will be&lt;/i&gt; with thee in the war.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; to day.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; into the king's hand.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">But Jehoshaphat said, &lt;i&gt;Is there&lt;/i&gt; not here a prophet of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; besides, that we might enquire of him?</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, &lt;i&gt;There is&lt;/i&gt; yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And the king of Israel called for one &lt;i&gt;of his&lt;/i&gt; officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall deliver &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; into the hand of the king.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets &lt;i&gt;declare&lt;/i&gt; good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And Micaiah said, &lt;i&gt;As&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;?</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said, These have no master; let them return &lt;i&gt;therefore&lt;/i&gt; every man to his house in peace.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; I saw the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and &lt;i&gt;on&lt;/i&gt; his left.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and said, I will entice him. And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto him, Wherewith?</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And &lt;i&gt;the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; said, Thou shalt entice &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; so.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Now therefore, behold, the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath spoken evil against thee.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; from me to speak unto thee?</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And say, Thus saith the king, Put this &lt;i&gt;fellow&lt;/i&gt; in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; hath not the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; helped him; and God moved them &lt;i&gt;to depart&lt;/i&gt; from him.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And a &lt;i&gt;certain&lt;/i&gt; man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed &lt;i&gt;himself&lt;/i&gt; up in &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.</verse>
