      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now of the things which we have spoken &lt;span class="extra"&gt;this is&lt;/span&gt; the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">For if that first &lt;span class="extra"&gt;covenant&lt;/span&gt; had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">For this &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">In that he saith, A new &lt;span class="extra"&gt;covenant&lt;/span&gt;, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; ready to vanish away.</verse>
