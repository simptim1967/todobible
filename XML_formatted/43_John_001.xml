      <verse number="1" id="v1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">The same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">There was a man sent from God, whose name &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; John.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt; through him might believe.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">He was not that Light, but &lt;i&gt;was sent&lt;/i&gt; to bear witness of that Light.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">&lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; to them that believe on his name:</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">For the law was given by Moses, &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19" newPara="true">And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">He said, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29" newPara="true">The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35" newPara="true">Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;What seek ye?&lt;/span&gt; They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">He saith unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Come and see.&lt;/span&gt; They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">One of the two which heard John &lt;i&gt;speak&lt;/i&gt;, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,&lt;/span&gt; which is by interpretation, A stone.</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43" newPara="true">The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Follow me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="49" id="v49">Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="50" id="v50">Jesus answered and said unto him, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="51" id="v51">And he saith unto him, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
