      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">For the vineyard of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">Woe unto them that join house to house, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; lay field to field, till &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there be&lt;/span&gt; no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">In mine ears &lt;span class='extra'&gt;said&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; great and fair, without inhabitant.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;till&lt;/span&gt; wine inflame them!</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, neither consider the operation of his hands.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13" newPara="true">Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because &lt;span class='extra'&gt;they have&lt;/span&gt; no knowledge: and their honourable men &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">But the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">That say, Let him make speed, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; hasten his work, that we may see &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;!</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Woe unto &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them that are&lt;/span&gt; wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Woe unto &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them that are&lt;/span&gt; mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Therefore is the anger of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; stretched out still.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26" newPara="true">And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Whose arrows &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Their roaring &lt;span class='extra'&gt;shall be&lt;/span&gt; like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; away safe, and none shall deliver &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if &lt;span class='extra'&gt;one&lt;/span&gt; look unto the land, behold darkness &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.</verse>
