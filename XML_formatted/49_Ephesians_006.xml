      <verse number="13" id="v13">Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</verse>

      <verse number="15" id="v15">And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">But that ye also may know my affairs, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; he might comfort your hearts.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Peace &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Grace &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.</verse>
