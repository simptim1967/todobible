      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then said he unto the disciples, &lt;span class='woc'&gt;It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe &lt;span class='extra'&gt;unto him&lt;/span&gt;, through whom they come!&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3" newPara="true">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And the Lord said, &lt;span class='woc'&gt;If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And they lifted up &lt;span class='extra'&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And when he saw &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;, he said unto them, &lt;span class='woc'&gt;Go shew yourselves unto the priests.&lt;/span&gt; And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And fell down on &lt;span class='extra'&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And Jesus answering said, &lt;span class='woc'&gt;Were there not ten cleansed? but where &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; the nine?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And he said unto him, &lt;span class='woc'&gt;Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, &lt;span class='woc'&gt;The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And he said unto the disciples, &lt;span class='woc'&gt;The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;, nor follow &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one &lt;span class='extra'&gt;part&lt;/span&gt; under heaven, shineth unto the other &lt;span class='extra'&gt;part&lt;/span&gt; under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; all.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;Remember Lot's wife.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;I tell you, in that night there shall be two &lt;span class='extra'&gt;men&lt;/span&gt; in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;Two &lt;span class='extra'&gt;women&lt;/span&gt; shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">&lt;span class='woc'&gt;Two &lt;span class='extra'&gt;men&lt;/span&gt; shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, &lt;span class='woc'&gt;Wheresoever the body &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;, thither will the eagles be gathered together.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
