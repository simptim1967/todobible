      <verse number="1" id="v1">Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;which was&lt;/span&gt; the breadth of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And the breadth of the door &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; ten cubits; and the sides of the door &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the most holy &lt;span class='extra'&gt;place&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of &lt;span class='extra'&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And the side chambers &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there was&lt;/span&gt; an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was still&lt;/span&gt; upward, and so increased &lt;span class='extra'&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; the lowest &lt;span class='extra'&gt;chamber&lt;/span&gt; to the highest by the midst.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; a full reed of six great cubits.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">The thickness of the wall, which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; for the side chamber without, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; five cubits: and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; left &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; the place of the side chambers that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; within.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And between the chambers &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And the doors of the side chambers &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; toward &lt;span class='extra'&gt;the place that was&lt;/span&gt; left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; five cubits round about.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Now the building that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; before the separate place at the end toward the west &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; covered;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it was&lt;/span&gt; made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; between a cherub and a cherub; and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; cherub had two faces;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">So that the face of a man &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it was&lt;/span&gt; made through all the house round about.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">From the ground unto above the door &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; cherubims and palm trees made, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; the wall of the temple.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">The posts of the temple &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; squared, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; the face of the sanctuary; the appearance &lt;span class='extra'&gt;of the one&lt;/span&gt; as the appearance &lt;span class='extra'&gt;of the other&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">The altar of wood &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; of wood: and he said unto me, This &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the table that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; before the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And the doors had two leaves &lt;span class='extra'&gt;apiece&lt;/span&gt;, two turning leaves; two &lt;span class='extra'&gt;leaves&lt;/span&gt; for the one door, and two leaves for the other &lt;span class='extra'&gt;door&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there were&lt;/span&gt; made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; made upon the walls; and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there were&lt;/span&gt; thick planks upon the face of the porch without.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there were&lt;/span&gt; narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;upon&lt;/span&gt; the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.</verse>
