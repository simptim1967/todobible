      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; over the city. And he went in in my sight.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Then the glory of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; went up from the cherub, &lt;i&gt;and stood&lt;/i&gt; over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s glory.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And it came to pass, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; between the cherubims, and took &lt;i&gt;thereof&lt;/i&gt;, and put &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; into the hands of &lt;i&gt;him that was&lt;/i&gt; clothed with linen: who took &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, and went out.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; as the colour of a beryl stone.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And &lt;i&gt;as for&lt;/i&gt; their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; full of eyes round about, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; the wheels that they four had.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And every one had four faces: the first face &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the face of a cherub, and the second face &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And the cherubims were lifted up. This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">When they stood, &lt;i&gt;these&lt;/i&gt; stood; and when they were lifted up, &lt;i&gt;these&lt;/i&gt; lifted up themselves &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt;: for the spirit of the living creature &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; in them.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Then the glory of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; beside them, and &lt;i&gt;every one&lt;/i&gt; stood at the door of the east gate of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s house; and the glory of the God of Israel &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; over them above.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; the cherubims.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; under their wings.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And the likeness of their faces &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.</verse>
