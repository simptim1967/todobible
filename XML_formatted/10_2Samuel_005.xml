      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; thy bone and thy flesh.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: and they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">David &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; thirty years old when he began to reign, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; he reigned forty years.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the city of David.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, &lt;i&gt;that are&lt;/i&gt; hated of David's soul, &lt;i&gt;he shall be chief and captain&lt;/i&gt;. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And David went on, and grew great, and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of hosts &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; with him.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And David perceived that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13" newPara="true">And David took &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And these &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard &lt;i&gt;of it&lt;/i&gt;, and went down to the hold.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And David enquired of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22" newPara="true">And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And when David enquired of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, he said, Thou shalt not go up; &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And David did so, as the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</verse>
