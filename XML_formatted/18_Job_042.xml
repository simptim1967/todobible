      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then Job answered the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and said,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">I know that thou canst do every &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; no thought can be withholden from thee.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Who &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Wherefore I abhor &lt;i&gt;myself&lt;/i&gt;, and repent in dust and ashes.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">And it was &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt;, that after the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had spoken these words unto Job, the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me &lt;i&gt;the thing that is&lt;/i&gt; right, as my servant Job &lt;i&gt;hath&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you &lt;i&gt;after your&lt;/i&gt; folly, in that ye have not spoken of me &lt;i&gt;the thing which is&lt;/i&gt; right, like my servant Job.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; commanded them: the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; also accepted Job.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">So the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And in all the land were no women found &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; four generations.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">So Job died, &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; old and full of days.</verse>
