      <verse number="1" id="v1">So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of &lt;i&gt;such as were&lt;/i&gt; oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors &lt;i&gt;there was&lt;/i&gt; power; but they had no comforter.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Yea, better &lt;i&gt;is he&lt;/i&gt; than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; also vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Better &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; an handful &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; quietness, than both the hands full &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; travail and vexation of spirit.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">There is one &lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet &lt;i&gt;is there&lt;/i&gt; no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither &lt;i&gt;saith he&lt;/i&gt;, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; also vanity, yea, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a sore travail.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">Two &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him &lt;i&gt;that is&lt;/i&gt; alone when he falleth; for &lt;i&gt;he hath&lt;/i&gt; not another to help him up.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm &lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt;?</verse>

      <verse number="14" id="v14">For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also &lt;i&gt;he that is&lt;/i&gt; born in his kingdom becometh poor.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">&lt;i&gt;There is&lt;/i&gt; no end of all the people, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
