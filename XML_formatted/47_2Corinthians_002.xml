      <verse number="1" id="v1">But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the joy&lt;/span&gt; of you all.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Sufficient to such a man &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; this punishment, which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was inflicted&lt;/span&gt; of many.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">So that contrariwise ye &lt;span class="extra"&gt;ought&lt;/span&gt; rather to forgive &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt;, and comfort &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt;, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm &lt;span class="extra"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; love toward him.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">To whom ye forgive any thing, I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;forgive&lt;/span&gt; also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, for your sakes &lt;span class="extra"&gt;forgave I it&lt;/span&gt; in the person of Christ;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Furthermore, when I came to Troas to &lt;span class="extra"&gt;preach&lt;/span&gt; Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Now thanks &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">To the one &lt;span class="extra"&gt;we are&lt;/span&gt; the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; sufficient for these things?</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</verse>
