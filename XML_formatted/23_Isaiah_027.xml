      <verse number="4" id="v4">Fury &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; not in me: who would set the briers &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Or let him take hold of my strength, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; he may make peace with me; &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; he shall make peace with me.</verse>

      <verse number="9" id="v9">By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Yet the defenced city &lt;span class='extra'&gt;shall be&lt;/span&gt; desolate, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; set them on fire: for it &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.</verse>
