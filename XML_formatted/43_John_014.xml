      <verse number="1" id="v1">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;In my Father's house are many mansions: if &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it were&lt;/span&gt; not &lt;span class="extra"&gt;so&lt;/span&gt;, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;there&lt;/span&gt; ye may be also.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Jesus saith unto him, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Jesus saith unto him, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou &lt;span class="extra"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;, Shew us the Father?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Believe me that I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater &lt;span class="extra"&gt;works&lt;/span&gt; than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;If ye love me, keep my commandments.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;&lt;span class="extra"&gt;Even&lt;/span&gt; the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;At that day ye shall know that I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Jesus answered and said unto him, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;These things have I spoken unto you, being &lt;span class="extra"&gt;yet&lt;/span&gt; present with you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But the Comforter, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;which is&lt;/span&gt; the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come &lt;span class="extra"&gt;again&lt;/span&gt; unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
