      <verse number="1" id="v1">And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And he said unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And he said unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all &lt;i&gt;these&lt;/i&gt; things are done in parables:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; sins should be forgiven them.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And he said unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;The sower soweth the word.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21" newPara="true">And he said unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And he said unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26" newPara="true">And he said, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30" newPara="true">And he said, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is&lt;/i&gt; like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Let us pass over unto the other side.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Peace, be still.&lt;/span&gt; And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">And he said unto them, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</verse>
