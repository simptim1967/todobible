      <verse number="11" id="v11">And Moses said unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?</verse>

      <verse number="18" id="v18">And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for &lt;i&gt;it was&lt;/i&gt; well with us in Egypt: therefore the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</verse>

      <verse number="20" id="v20">&lt;i&gt;But&lt;/i&gt; even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And Moses said, The people, among whom I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</verse>

      <verse number="26" id="v26">But there remained two &lt;i&gt;of the&lt;/i&gt; men in the camp, the name of the one &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</verse>

      <verse number="31" id="v31" newPara="true">And there went forth a wind from the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and brought quails from the sea, and let &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits &lt;i&gt;high&lt;/i&gt; upon the face of the earth.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And the people stood up all that day, and all &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And while the flesh &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was kindled against the people, and the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; smote the people with a very great plague.</verse>
