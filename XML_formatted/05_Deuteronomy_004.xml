      <verse number="2" id="v2">Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish &lt;span class="extra"&gt;ought&lt;/span&gt; from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God which I command you.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Your eyes have seen what the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God hath destroyed them from among you.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">But ye that did cleave unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; alive every one of you this day.</verse>

      <verse number="13" id="v13">And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.</verse>

      <verse number="25" id="v25" newPara="true">When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt &lt;span class="extra"&gt;yourselves&lt;/span&gt;, and make a graven image, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; the likeness of any &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;, and shall do evil in the sight of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God, to provoke him to anger:</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong &lt;span class="extra"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall lead you.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">But if from thence thou shalt seek the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God, thou shalt find &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt;, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; in the latter days, if thou turn to the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">(For the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;ask&lt;/span&gt; from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been &lt;span class="extra"&gt;any such thing&lt;/span&gt; as this great thing &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;, or hath been heard like it?</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">Did &lt;span class="extra"&gt;ever&lt;/span&gt; people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?</verse>

      <verse number="38" id="v38">To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou &lt;span class="extra"&gt;art&lt;/span&gt;, to bring thee in, to give thee their land &lt;span class="extra"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; an inheritance, as &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; this day.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">Know therefore this day, and consider &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; in thine heart, that the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; he &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: &lt;span class="extra"&gt;there is&lt;/span&gt; none else.</verse>
