      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of your fathers giveth you.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God which I command you.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Your eyes have seen what the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God hath destroyed them from among you.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">But ye that did cleave unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; alive every one of you this day.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Keep therefore and do &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;; for this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a wise and understanding people.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">For what nation &lt;i&gt;is there so&lt;/i&gt; great, who &lt;i&gt;hath&lt;/i&gt; God &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; nigh unto them, as the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in all &lt;i&gt;things that&lt;/i&gt; we call upon him &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt;?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And what nation &lt;i&gt;is there so&lt;/i&gt; great, that hath statutes and judgments &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;</verse>

      <verse number="11" id="v11">And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only &lt;i&gt;ye heard&lt;/i&gt; a voice.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.</verse>

      <verse number="16" id="v16">Lest ye corrupt &lt;i&gt;yourselves&lt;/i&gt;, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</verse>

      <verse number="18" id="v18">The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in the waters beneath the earth:</verse>

      <verse number="20" id="v20">But the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as &lt;i&gt;ye are&lt;/i&gt; this day.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Furthermore the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God giveth thee &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; an inheritance:</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; the likeness of any &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;, which the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God hath forbidden thee.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">For the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a consuming fire, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; a jealous God.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25" newPara="true">When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt &lt;i&gt;yourselves&lt;/i&gt;, and make a graven image, &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; the likeness of any &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;, and shall do evil in the sight of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God, to provoke him to anger:</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall lead you.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">But if from thence thou shalt seek the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God, thou shalt find &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; in the latter days, if thou turn to the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">(For the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and &lt;i&gt;ask&lt;/i&gt; from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been &lt;i&gt;any such thing&lt;/i&gt; as this great thing &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, or hath been heard like it?</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">Did &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">Or hath God assayed to go &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; take him a nation from the midst of &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; God; &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; none else beside him.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt;, to bring thee in, to give thee their land &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; an inheritance, as &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt; this day.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">Know therefore this day, and consider &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; in thine heart, that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; none else.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong &lt;i&gt;thy&lt;/i&gt; days upon the earth, which the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God giveth thee, for ever.</verse>
