      <verse number="1" id="v1">And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And he sent Eliakim, which &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; not strength to bring forth.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">It may be the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up &lt;i&gt;thy&lt;/i&gt; prayer for the remnant that are left.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8" newPara="true">So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; in Thelasar?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Where &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?</verse>

      <verse number="15" id="v15">And Hezekiah prayed before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and said, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of Israel, which dwellest &lt;i&gt;between&lt;/i&gt; the cherubims, thou art the God, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">&lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Of a truth, &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And have cast their gods into the fire: for they &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Now therefore, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; thou only.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of Israel, &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the word that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted &lt;i&gt;thy&lt;/i&gt; voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; against the Holy &lt;i&gt;One&lt;/i&gt; of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, &lt;i&gt;and into&lt;/i&gt; the forest of his Carmel.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Hast thou not heard long ago &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; I have done it, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; ruinous heaps.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; the grass of the field, and &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; the green herb, &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; the grass on the housetops, and &lt;i&gt;as corn&lt;/i&gt; blasted before it be grown up.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And this &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;of hosts&lt;/i&gt; shall do this.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">Therefore thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35" newPara="true">And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; all dead corpses.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
