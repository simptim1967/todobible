      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; a place for cattle;</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;Even&lt;/span&gt; the country which the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; smote before the congregation of Israel, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; bring us not over Jordan.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath given them?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had given them.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, was consumed.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; toward Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16" newPara="true">And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; to war,</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And the land be subdued before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: and be sure your sin will find you out.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; to battle, as my lord saith.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">We will pass over armed before the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan &lt;span class="extra"&gt;may be&lt;/span&gt; ours.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And Moses gave unto them, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the cities of the country round about.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34" newPara="true">And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; in it.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havoth-jair.</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</verse>
