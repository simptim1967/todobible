      <verse number="1" id="v1">And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</verse>

      <verse number="4" id="v4">And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</verse>

      <verse number="6" id="v6">Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the son of Tabeal:</verse>

      <verse number="9" id="v9">And the head of Ephraim &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; Samaria, and the head of Samaria &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">Moreover the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake again unto Ahaz, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Ask thee a sign of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</verse>

      <verse number="18" id="v18">And it shall come to pass in that day, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall hiss for the fly that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in the land of Assyria.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;namely&lt;/span&gt;, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</verse>

      <verse number="24" id="v24">With arrows and with bows shall &lt;span class='extra'&gt;men&lt;/span&gt; come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.</verse>
