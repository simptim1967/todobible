      <verse number="1" id="v1">And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.</verse>

      <verse number="4" id="v4">And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; there was no more spirit in her.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And she said to the king, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;It was&lt;/span&gt; a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: &lt;span class="extra"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; thou exceedest the fame that I heard.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Happy &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; thy men, and happy &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Blessed be the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;to be&lt;/span&gt; king for the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And the king made &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; the algum trees terraces to the house of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.</verse>

      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">And king Solomon made two hundred targets &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; beaten gold: six hundred &lt;span class="extra"&gt;shekels&lt;/span&gt; of beaten gold went to one target.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And three hundred shields &lt;span class="extra"&gt;made he of&lt;/span&gt; beaten gold: three hundred &lt;span class="extra"&gt;shekels&lt;/span&gt; of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</verse>

      <verse number="19" id="v19">And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were of&lt;/span&gt; gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were of&lt;/span&gt; pure gold: none &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were of&lt;/span&gt; silver; it was &lt;span class="extra"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</verse>
