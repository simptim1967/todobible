      <verse number="1" id="v1">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts: the whole earth &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; full of his glory.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5" newPara="true">Then said I, Woe &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; me! for I am undone; because I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And he laid &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; I; send me.</verse>

      <verse number="10" id="v10">Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; have removed men far away, and &lt;i&gt;there be&lt;/i&gt; a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13" newPara="true">But yet in it &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; a tenth, and &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in them, when they cast &lt;i&gt;their leaves: so&lt;/i&gt; the holy seed &lt;i&gt;shall be&lt;/i&gt; the substance thereof.</verse>
