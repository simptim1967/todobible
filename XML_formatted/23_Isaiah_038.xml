And Hezekiah wept sore.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">Then came the word of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; to Isaiah, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</verse>

      <verse number="8" id="v8">Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.</verse>

      <verse number="11" id="v11">I said, I shall not see the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; to night wilt thou make an end of me.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">I reckoned till morning, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; to night wilt thou make an end of me.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Like a crane &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail &lt;i&gt;with looking&lt;/i&gt; upward: O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, I am oppressed; undertake for me.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>

      <verse number="17" id="v17">Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul &lt;i&gt;delivered it&lt;/i&gt; from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</verse>

      <verse number="21" id="v21">For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.</verse>
