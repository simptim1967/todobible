      <verse number="6" id="v6">For I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?</verse>

      <verse number="11" id="v11">And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts.</verse>

      <verse number="17" id="v17">And they shall be mine, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</verse>
