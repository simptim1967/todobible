      <verse number="1" id="v1">For we know that if our earthly house of &lt;span class='extra'&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For we that are in &lt;span class='extra'&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Therefore &lt;span class='extra'&gt;we are&lt;/span&gt; always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">We are confident, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;I say&lt;/span&gt;, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things &lt;span class='extra'&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class='extra'&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; body, according to that he hath done, whether &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it be&lt;/span&gt; good or bad.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to &lt;span class='extra'&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">For whether we be beside ourselves, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; to God: or whether we be sober, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; for your cause.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; no more.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Therefore if any man &lt;span class='extra'&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; in Christ, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;he is&lt;/span&gt; a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And all things &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech &lt;span class='extra'&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; by us: we pray &lt;span class='extra'&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">For he hath made him &lt;span class='extra'&gt;to be&lt;/span&gt; sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</verse>
