      <verse number="1" id="v1">In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples &lt;i&gt;unto him&lt;/i&gt;, and saith unto them,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">&lt;woc&gt;I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">&lt;woc&gt;And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt; with bread here in the wilderness?</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And he asked them, &lt;woc&gt;How many loaves have ye?&lt;/woc&gt; And they said, Seven.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;; and they did set &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; before the people.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken &lt;i&gt;meat&lt;/i&gt; that was left seven baskets.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, &lt;woc&gt;Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">Now &lt;i&gt;the disciples&lt;/i&gt; had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And he charged them, saying, &lt;woc&gt;Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; the leaven of Herod.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, &lt;i&gt;It is&lt;/i&gt; because we have no bread.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And when Jesus knew &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, he saith unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;woc&gt;Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">&lt;woc&gt;When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?&lt;/woc&gt; They say unto him, Twelve.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">&lt;woc&gt;And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?&lt;/woc&gt; And they said, Seven.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And he said unto them, &lt;woc&gt;How is it that ye do not understand?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22" newPara="true">And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">After that he put &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And he sent him away to his house, saying, &lt;woc&gt;Neither go into the town, nor tell &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; to any in the town.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27" newPara="true">And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Whom do men say that I am?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">And they answered, John the Baptist: but some &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt;, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And he saith unto them, &lt;woc&gt;But whom say ye that I am?&lt;/woc&gt; And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, &lt;woc&gt;Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34" newPara="true" todo="true">And when he had called the people &lt;i&gt;unto him&lt;/i&gt; with his disciples also, he said unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Whosoever will come after me, &lt;todo&gt;&lt;a href="../todo/todo_deny_yourself.html" title="Deny yourself and take up your cross daily and follow Jesus."&gt;TODO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/todo&gt;&lt;a href="../todo/todo_deny_yourself.html"&gt;let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">&lt;woc&gt;For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">&lt;woc&gt;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">&lt;woc&gt;Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">&lt;woc&gt;Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
