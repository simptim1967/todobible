      <verse number="3" id="v3">And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And the smoke of the incense, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;which came&lt;/span&gt; with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</verse>

      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!</verse>
