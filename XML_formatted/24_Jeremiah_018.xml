      <verse number="2" id="v2">Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Then the word of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; came to me, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;. Behold, as the clay &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in the potter's hand, so &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;At what&lt;/span&gt; instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</verse>

      <verse number="10" id="v10">If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Therefore thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.</verse>

      <verse number="15" id="v15">Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways &lt;span class="extra"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; the ancient paths, to walk in paths, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; a way not cast up;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">To make their land desolate, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Give heed to me, O &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; to turn away thy wrath from them.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their &lt;span class="extra"&gt;blood&lt;/span&gt; by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; widows; and let their men be put to death; &lt;span class="extra"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; their young men &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; slain by the sword in battle.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Yet, &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay &lt;span class="extra"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thus&lt;/span&gt; with them in the time of thine anger.</verse>
