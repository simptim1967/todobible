      <verse number="2" id="v2">Who can utter the mighty acts of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;? &lt;span class='extra'&gt;who&lt;/span&gt; can shew forth all his praise?</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Blessed &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; they that keep judgment, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; he that doeth righteousness at all times.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Remember me, O &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, with the favour &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that thou bearest unto&lt;/span&gt; thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; at the sea, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; at the Red sea.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And he saved them from the hand of him that hated &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">They envied Moses also in the camp, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; Aaron the saint of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</verse>

      <verse number="19" id="v19">They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</verse>

      <verse number="22" id="v22">Wondrous works in the land of Ham, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; terrible things by the Red sea.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">But murmured in their tents, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; hearkened not unto the voice of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Thus they provoked &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; the plague was stayed.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">They angered &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; commanded them:</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">And shed innocent blood, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">Therefore was the wrath of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44">Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45">And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47">Save us, O &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; to triumph in thy praise.</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">Blessed &lt;span class='extra'&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
