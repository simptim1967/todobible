      <verse number="1" id="v1">Hear, O Israel: Thou &lt;span class='extra'&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;of whom&lt;/span&gt; thou hast heard &lt;span class='extra'&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;, Who can stand before the children of Anak!</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Understand therefore this day, that the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; he which goeth over before thee; &lt;span class='extra'&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath said unto thee.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; doth drive them out from before thee.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Understand therefore, that the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou &lt;span class='extra'&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; a stiffnecked people.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">Remember, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; forget not, how thou provokedst the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Also in Horeb ye provoked the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; to wrath, so that the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was angry with you to have destroyed you.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the tables of the covenant which the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was written&lt;/span&gt; according to all the words, which the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; gave me the two tables of stone, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; the tables of the covenant.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted &lt;span class='extra'&gt;themselves&lt;/span&gt;; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Furthermore the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a stiffnecked people:</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; in my two hands.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had commanded you.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And I fell down before the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, to provoke him to anger.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was wroth against you to destroy you. But the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hearkened unto me at that time also.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; ground &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; very small, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; to wrath.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Likewise when the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Ye have been rebellious against the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; from the day that I knew you.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Thus I fell down before the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; forty days and forty nights, as I fell down &lt;span class='extra'&gt;at the first&lt;/span&gt;; because the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had said he would destroy you.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">I prayed therefore unto the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and said, O Lord &lt;span class='nog'&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Yet they &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</verse>
