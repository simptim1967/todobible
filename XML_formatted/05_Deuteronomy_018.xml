      <verse number="17" id="v17">And the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto me, They have well &lt;span class='extra'&gt;spoken that&lt;/span&gt; which they have spoken.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.</verse>

      <verse number="20" id="v20">But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath not spoken?</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">When a prophet speaketh in the name of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the thing which the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath not spoken, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;but&lt;/span&gt; the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.</verse>
