      <verse number="1" id="v1">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, and make cakes upon the hearth.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">And they said unto him, Where &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; in the tent door, which &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; behind him.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Now Abraham and Sarah &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; old &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; well stricken in age; &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Is any thing too hard for the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16" newPara="true">And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, to do justice and judgment; that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23" newPara="true">And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; therein?</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which &lt;i&gt;am but&lt;/i&gt; dust and ashes:</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for &lt;i&gt;lack of&lt;/i&gt; five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; for forty's sake.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">And he said &lt;i&gt;unto him&lt;/i&gt;, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, if I find thirty there.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; for twenty's sake.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; for ten's sake.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</verse>
