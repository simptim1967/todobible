      <verse number="1" id="v1">And he spake a parable unto them &lt;i&gt;to this end&lt;/i&gt;, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Saying, &lt;woc&gt;There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">&lt;woc&gt;And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;woc&gt;And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">&lt;woc&gt;Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And the Lord said, &lt;woc&gt;Hear what the unjust judge saith.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;woc&gt;And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;woc&gt;I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">&lt;woc&gt;Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">&lt;woc&gt;The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">&lt;woc&gt;I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">&lt;woc&gt;And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">&lt;woc&gt;I tell you, this man went down to his house justified &lt;i&gt;rather&lt;/i&gt; than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; disciples saw &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, they rebuked them.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">But Jesus called them &lt;i&gt;unto him&lt;/i&gt;, and said, &lt;woc&gt;Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">&lt;woc&gt;Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And Jesus said unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Why callest thou me good? none &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; good, save one, &lt;i&gt;that is&lt;/i&gt;, God.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">&lt;woc&gt;Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, &lt;woc&gt;How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">&lt;woc&gt;For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And they that heard &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; said, Who then can be saved?</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And he said, &lt;woc&gt;The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And he said unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">&lt;woc&gt;Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31" newPara="true">Then he took &lt;i&gt;unto him&lt;/i&gt; the twelve, and said unto them, &lt;woc&gt;Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">&lt;woc&gt;For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">&lt;woc&gt;And they shall scourge &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35" newPara="true">And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">And he cried, saying, Jesus, &lt;i&gt;thou&lt;/i&gt; Son of David, have mercy on me.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, &lt;i&gt;Thou&lt;/i&gt; Son of David, have mercy on me.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">Saying, &lt;woc&gt;What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?&lt;/woc&gt; And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">And Jesus said unto him, &lt;woc&gt;Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.&lt;/woc&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;, gave praise unto God.</verse>
