      <verse number="1" id="v1">And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">These &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; the generations of Jacob. Joseph, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;being&lt;/span&gt; seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of &lt;span class="extra"&gt;many&lt;/span&gt; colours.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5" newPara="true">And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">For, behold, we &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And he told &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the flock&lt;/span&gt; in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am I&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">And a certain man found him, and, behold, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;he was&lt;/span&gt; wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed &lt;span class="extra"&gt;their flocks&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And Reuben heard &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;but&lt;/span&gt; cast him into this pit that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23" newPara="true">And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; coat of &lt;span class="extra"&gt;many&lt;/span&gt; colours that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; on him;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; empty, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;there was&lt;/span&gt; no water in it.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; down to Egypt.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is it&lt;/span&gt; if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; our brother &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; our flesh. And his brethren were content.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty &lt;span class="extra"&gt;pieces&lt;/span&gt; of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29" newPara="true">And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; not; and I, whither shall I go?</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And they sent the coat of &lt;span class="extra"&gt;many&lt;/span&gt; colours, and they brought &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; thy son's coat or no.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And he knew it, and said, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;It is&lt;/span&gt; my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; captain of the guard.</verse>
