      <verse number="5" id="v5">And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt;, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; asunder:</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a sin offering.</verse>

      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; frankincense thereon: for it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a sin offering.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; a memorial thereof, and burn &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a sin offering.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and &lt;i&gt;the remnant&lt;/i&gt; shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering:</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; though he wist &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; not, and it shall be forgiven him.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
