      <verse number="1" id="v1">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto Moses, Depart, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou &lt;span class="extra"&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">For the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; every one which sought the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; without the camp.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; all the people rose up, and stood every man &lt;span class="extra"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood &lt;span class="extra"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; the door of the tabernacle, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; talked with Moses.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand &lt;span class="extra"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man &lt;span class="extra"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; his tent door.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">And Moses said unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; thy people.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And he said, My presence shall go &lt;span class="extra"&gt;with thee&lt;/span&gt;, and I will give thee rest.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And he said unto him, If thy presence go not &lt;span class="extra"&gt;with me&lt;/span&gt;, carry us not up hence.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is it&lt;/span&gt; not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; upon the face of the earth.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said, Behold, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;there is&lt;/span&gt; a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.</verse>
