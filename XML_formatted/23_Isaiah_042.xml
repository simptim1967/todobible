      <verse number="10" id="v10">Sing unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; a new song, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up &lt;i&gt;their voice&lt;/i&gt;, the villages &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</verse>

      <verse number="14" id="v14">I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; refrained myself: &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.</verse>

These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; our gods.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Who &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; I sent? who &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; blind as &lt;i&gt;he that is&lt;/i&gt; perfect, and blind as the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;'s servant?</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; honourable.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">But this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a people robbed and spoiled; &lt;i&gt;they are&lt;/i&gt; all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Who among you will give ear to this? &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; will hearken and hear for the time to come?</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; not to heart.</verse>
