      <verse number="1" id="v1">And David numbered the people that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now &lt;span class='extra'&gt;thou art&lt;/span&gt; worth ten thousand of us: therefore now &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; better that thou succour us out of the city.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;Deal&lt;/span&gt; gently for my sake with the young man, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand &lt;span class='extra'&gt;men&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; under him went away.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And a certain man saw &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest &lt;span class='extra'&gt;him&lt;/span&gt;, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten &lt;span class='extra'&gt;shekels&lt;/span&gt; of silver, and a girdle.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand &lt;span class='extra'&gt;shekels&lt;/span&gt; of silver in mine hand, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;yet&lt;/span&gt; would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none &lt;span class='extra'&gt;touch&lt;/span&gt; the young man Absalom.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against &lt;span class='extra'&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; yet alive in the midst of the oak.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19" newPara="true">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath avenged him of his enemies.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">But howsoever, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;said he&lt;/span&gt;, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he &lt;span class='extra'&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; alone, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there is&lt;/span&gt; tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold &lt;span class='extra'&gt;another&lt;/span&gt; man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed &lt;span class='extra'&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it was&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">And the king said &lt;span class='extra'&gt;unto him&lt;/span&gt;, Turn aside, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do &lt;span class='extra'&gt;thee&lt;/span&gt; hurt, be as &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; young man &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33" newPara="true">And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</verse>
