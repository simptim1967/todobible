      <verse number="1" id="v1">Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">My words &lt;span class="extra"&gt;shall be of&lt;/span&gt; the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">If thou canst answer me, set &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thy words&lt;/span&gt; in order before me, stand up.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Behold, I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thy&lt;/span&gt; words, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;saying&lt;/span&gt;,</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">I am clean without transgression, I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; innocent; neither &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is there&lt;/span&gt; iniquity in me.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Behold, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">For God speaketh once, yea twice, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;yet man&lt;/span&gt; perceiveth it not.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">That he may withdraw man &lt;span class="extra"&gt;from his&lt;/span&gt; purpose, and hide pride from man.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong &lt;span class="extra"&gt;pain&lt;/span&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; were not seen stick out.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">He looketh upon men, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;if any&lt;/span&gt; say, I have sinned, and perverted &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that which was&lt;/span&gt; right, and it profited me not;</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Lo, all these &lt;span class="extra"&gt;things&lt;/span&gt; worketh God oftentimes with man,</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</verse>
