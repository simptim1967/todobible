      <verse number="1" id="v1">I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the image of&lt;/span&gt; Baal.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And if by grace, then &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is it&lt;/span&gt; no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it be&lt;/span&gt; of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but &lt;span class="extra"&gt;rather&lt;/span&gt; through their fall salvation &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is come&lt;/span&gt; unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Now if the fall of them &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">If by any means I may provoke to emulation &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them which are&lt;/span&gt; my flesh, and might save some of them.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">For if the casting away of them &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; the reconciling of the world, what &lt;span class="extra"&gt;shall&lt;/span&gt; the receiving &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of them be&lt;/span&gt;, but life from the dead?</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">For if the firstfruit &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; holy, the lump &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; also &lt;span class="extra"&gt;holy&lt;/span&gt;: and if the root &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; holy, so &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; the branches.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">For if God spared not the natural branches, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;take heed&lt;/span&gt; lest he also spare not thee.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural &lt;span class="extra"&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;, be graffed into their own olive tree?</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">For this &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">As concerning the gospel, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;they are&lt;/span&gt; enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;they are&lt;/span&gt; beloved for the fathers' sakes.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">For the gifts and calling of God &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; without repentance.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">For of him, and through him, and to him, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; all things: to whom &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; glory for ever. Amen.</verse>
