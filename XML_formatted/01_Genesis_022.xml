      <verse number="1" id="v1">And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt; I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And he said, Take now thy son, thine only &lt;i&gt;son&lt;/i&gt; Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3" newPara="true">And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the lamb for a burnt offering?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And the angel of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; I.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only &lt;i&gt;son&lt;/i&gt; from me.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; this day, In the mount of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; it shall be seen.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">And the angel of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only &lt;i&gt;son&lt;/i&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.</verse>

      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And his concubine, whose name &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.</verse>
