      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">&lt;span class='extra'&gt;If&lt;/span&gt; we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">&lt;span class='extra'&gt;Is&lt;/span&gt; not &lt;span class='extra'&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Remember, I pray thee, who &lt;span class='extra'&gt;ever&lt;/span&gt; perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; before mine eyes, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there was&lt;/span&gt; silence, and I heard a voice, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;saying&lt;/span&gt;,</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">How much less &lt;span class='extra'&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in the dust, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;which&lt;/span&gt; are crushed before the moth?</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Doth not their excellency &lt;span class='extra'&gt;which is&lt;/span&gt; in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</verse>
