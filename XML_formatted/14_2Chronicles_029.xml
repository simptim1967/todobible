      <verse number="1" id="v1">Hezekiah began to reign &lt;span class='extra'&gt;when he was&lt;/span&gt; five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And he did &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that which was&lt;/span&gt; right in the sight of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, according to all that David his father had done.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3" newPara="true">He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and repaired them.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy &lt;span class='extra'&gt;place&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">For our fathers have trespassed, and done &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that which was&lt;/span&gt; evil in the eyes of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and turned &lt;span class='extra'&gt;their&lt;/span&gt; backs.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy &lt;span class='extra'&gt;place&lt;/span&gt; unto the God of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Wherefore the wrath of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; in captivity for this.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Now &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; in mine heart to make a covenant with the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">My sons, be not now negligent: for the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, to cleanse the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, to cleanse &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; into the court of the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;. And the Levites took &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, to carry &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; out abroad into the brook Kidron.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Now they began on the first &lt;span class='extra'&gt;day&lt;/span&gt; of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: so they sanctified the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; before the altar of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20" newPara="true">Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; on the altar of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And they brought forth the he goats &lt;span class='extra'&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; the burnt offering and the sin offering &lt;span class='extra'&gt;should be made&lt;/span&gt; for all Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And he set the Levites in the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for &lt;span class='extra'&gt;so was&lt;/span&gt; the commandment of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; by his prophets.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; began &lt;span class='extra'&gt;also&lt;/span&gt; with the trumpets, and with the instruments &lt;span class='extra'&gt;ordained&lt;/span&gt; by David king of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; all &lt;span class='extra'&gt;this continued&lt;/span&gt; until the burnt offering was finished.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; two hundred lambs: all these &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; for a burnt offering to the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">And the consecrated things &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the &lt;span class='extra'&gt;other&lt;/span&gt; priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">And also the burnt offerings &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for &lt;span class='extra'&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; burnt offering. So the service of the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was set in order.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was &lt;span class='extra'&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; suddenly.</verse>
