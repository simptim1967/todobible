      <verse number="1" id="v1">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4" newPara="true">And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">For thou &lt;span class="extra"&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;but&lt;/span&gt; to the house of Israel;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; impudent and hardhearted.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; a rebellious house.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord &lt;span class="nog"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;saying&lt;/span&gt;, Blessed &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; the glory of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; from his place.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;I heard&lt;/span&gt; also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was strong upon me.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; came unto me, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked &lt;span class="extra"&gt;man&lt;/span&gt; shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Again, When a righteous &lt;span class="extra"&gt;man&lt;/span&gt; doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous &lt;span class="extra"&gt;man&lt;/span&gt;, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22" newPara="true">And the hand of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; a rebellious house.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord &lt;span class="nog"&gt;God&lt;/span&gt;; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; a rebellious house.</verse>
