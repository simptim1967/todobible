      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</verse>

      <verse number="4" id="v4">So Abram departed, as the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</verse>

      <verse number="7" id="v7">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, who appeared unto him.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;having&lt;/span&gt; Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and called upon the name of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10" newPara="true">And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; grievous in the land.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou &lt;span class="extra"&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; a fair woman to look upon:</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Say, I pray thee, thou &lt;span class="extra"&gt;art&lt;/span&gt; my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; very fair.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.</verse>

      <verse number="19" id="v19">Why saidst thou, She &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take &lt;span class="extra"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;, and go thy way.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And Pharaoh commanded &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</verse>
