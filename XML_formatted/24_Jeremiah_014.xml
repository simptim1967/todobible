      <verse number="15" id="v15">Therefore thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17" newPara="true">Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; no healing for us? we looked for peace, and &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">We acknowledge, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, our wickedness, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Do not abhor &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Are there &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; not thou he, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
