      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">Then the word of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; came unto Jeremiah &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the prophet&lt;/span&gt;, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.</verse>
