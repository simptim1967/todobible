      <verse number="1" id="v1">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And Asa did &lt;i&gt;that which was&lt;/i&gt; good and right in the eyes of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; his God:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">For he took away the altars of the strange &lt;i&gt;gods&lt;/i&gt;, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And commanded Judah to seek the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had given him rest.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; walls, and towers, gates, and bars, &lt;i&gt;while&lt;/i&gt; the land &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; yet before us; because we have sought the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God, we have sought &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And Asa had an army &lt;i&gt;of men&lt;/i&gt; that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; mighty men of valour.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And Asa cried unto the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; his God, and said, &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;/i&gt; nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, thou &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; our God; let not man prevail against thee.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">So the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And Asa and the people that &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
