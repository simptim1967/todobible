      <verse number="3" id="v3">Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.</verse>

      <verse number="8" id="v8">Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt;.

      <verse number="10" id="v10">So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.</verse>
