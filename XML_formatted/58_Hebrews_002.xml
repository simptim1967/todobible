      <verse number="1" id="v1">Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; slip.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt;;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">God also bearing &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that is&lt;/span&gt; not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">For it became him, for whom &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; all things, and by whom &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">For verily he took not on &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him the nature of&lt;/span&gt; angels; but he took on &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; the seed of Abraham.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things &lt;span class="extra"&gt;pertaining&lt;/span&gt; to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</verse>
