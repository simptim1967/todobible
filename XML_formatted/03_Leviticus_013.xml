      <verse number="1" id="v1">And the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; deeper than the skin of his flesh, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">If the bright spot &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up &lt;i&gt;him that hath&lt;/i&gt; the plague seven days:</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; the plague in his sight be at a stay, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; the plague &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; somewhat dark, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it &lt;i&gt;is but&lt;/i&gt; a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a leprosy.</verse>

      <verse number="13" id="v13">Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; clean &lt;i&gt;that hath&lt;/i&gt; the plague: it is all turned white: he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; clean.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; the raw flesh &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; unclean: it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a leprosy.</verse>
