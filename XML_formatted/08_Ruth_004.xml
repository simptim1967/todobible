      <verse number="1" id="v1">Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; our brother Elimelech's:</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, redeem &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;: but if thou wilt not redeem &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it, then&lt;/span&gt; tell me, that I may know: for &lt;span class='extra'&gt;there is&lt;/span&gt; none to redeem &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; beside thee; and I &lt;span class='extra'&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; after thee. And he said, I will redeem &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Now this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was the manner&lt;/span&gt; in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; to his neighbour: and this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; a testimony in Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; for thee. So he drew off his shoe.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">And Boaz said unto the elders, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;unto&lt;/span&gt; all the people, Ye &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; witnesses this day, that I have bought all that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; Elimelech's, and all that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; witnesses this day.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And all the people that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; in the gate, and the elders, said, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;We are&lt;/span&gt; witnesses. The &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Beth-lehem:</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall give thee of this young woman.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13" newPara="true">So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; gave her conception, and she bare a son.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed &lt;span class='extra'&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And he shall be unto thee a restorer of &lt;span class='extra'&gt;thy&lt;/span&gt; life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the father of Jesse, the father of David.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">Now these &lt;span class='extra'&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</verse>
