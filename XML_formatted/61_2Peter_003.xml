      <verse number="1" id="v1">This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in &lt;span class="extra"&gt;both&lt;/span&gt; which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as &lt;span class="extra"&gt;they were&lt;/span&gt; from the beginning of the creation.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;Seeing&lt;/span&gt; then &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; all these things shall be dissolved, what manner &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of persons&lt;/span&gt; ought ye to be in &lt;span class="extra"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; holy conversation and godliness,</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And account &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; the longsuffering of our Lord &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">As also in all &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as &lt;span class="extra"&gt;they do&lt;/span&gt; also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know &lt;span class="extra"&gt;these things&lt;/span&gt; before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">But grow in grace, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; glory both now and for ever. Amen.</verse>
