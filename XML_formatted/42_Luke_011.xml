      <verse number="1" id="v1">And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And he said unto them, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Give us day by day our daily bread.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And he said unto them, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if &lt;span class="extra"&gt;he ask&lt;/span&gt; a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall &lt;span class="extra"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And others, tempting &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt;, sought of him a sign from heaven.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house &lt;span class="extra"&gt;divided&lt;/span&gt; against a house falleth.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; out? therefore shall they be your judges.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;And when he cometh, he findeth &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; swept and garnished.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Then goeth he, and taketh &lt;span class="extra"&gt;to him&lt;/span&gt; seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last &lt;span class="extra"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; of that man is worse than the first.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27" newPara="true">And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">But he said, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Yea rather, blessed &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; they that hear the word of God, and keep it.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29" newPara="true">And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; here.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; here.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thine eye&lt;/span&gt; is evil, thy body also &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; full of darkness.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;If thy whole body therefore &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37" newPara="true">And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">And when the Pharisee saw &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">And the Lord said unto him, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;&lt;span class="extra"&gt;Ye&lt;/span&gt; fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over &lt;span class="extra"&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; are not aware &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of them&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45" newPara="true">Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">And he said, &lt;span class="woc"&gt;Woe unto you also, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;ye&lt;/span&gt; lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="48" id="v48">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="49" id="v49">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; of them they shall slay and persecute:&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="50" id="v50">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="51" id="v51">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="52" id="v52">&lt;span class="woc"&gt;Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.&lt;/span&gt;</verse>
      <verse number="53" id="v53">And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge &lt;span class="extra"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:</verse>
      <verse number="54" id="v54">Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</verse>
