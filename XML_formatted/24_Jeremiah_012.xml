      <verse number="1" id="v1">Righteous &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; thou, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of &lt;i&gt;thy&lt;/i&gt; judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? &lt;i&gt;wherefore&lt;/i&gt; are all they happy that deal very treacherously?</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">But thou, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5" newPara="true">If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; in the land of peace, &lt;i&gt;wherein&lt;/i&gt; thou trustedst, &lt;i&gt;they wearied thee&lt;/i&gt;, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Mine heritage &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; unto me &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; a speckled bird, the birds round about &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">They have made it desolate, &lt;i&gt;and being&lt;/i&gt; desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; to heart.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; shall devour from the &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; end of the land even to the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
