      <verse number="1" id="v1">The fool hath said in his heart, &lt;i&gt;There is&lt;/i&gt; no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; none that doeth good.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; that did understand, that did seek God.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; none that doeth good, no, not one.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people &lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; they eat bread: they have not called upon God.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">There were they in great fear, &lt;i&gt;where&lt;/i&gt; no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; thee: thou hast put &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; to shame, because God hath despised them.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Oh that the salvation of Israel &lt;i&gt;were come&lt;/i&gt; out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Israel shall be glad.</verse>
