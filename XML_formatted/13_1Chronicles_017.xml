      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;remaineth&lt;/i&gt; under curtains.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in thine heart; for God &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; with thee.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3" newPara="true">And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; tabernacle &lt;i&gt;to another&lt;/i&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; in the earth.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And since the time that I commanded judges &lt;i&gt;to be&lt;/i&gt; over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will build thee an house.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go &lt;i&gt;to be&lt;/i&gt; with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; that was before thee:</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16" newPara="true">And David the king came and sat before the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and said, Who &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; I, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God, and what &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">What can David &lt;i&gt;speak&lt;/i&gt; more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all &lt;i&gt;these&lt;/i&gt; great things.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; none like thee, neither &lt;i&gt;is there any&lt;/i&gt; God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And what one nation in the earth &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem &lt;i&gt;to be&lt;/i&gt; his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, becamest their God.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Therefore now, &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the God of Israel, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; a God to Israel: and &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; the house of David thy servant &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; established before thee.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found &lt;i&gt;in his heart&lt;/i&gt; to pray before thee.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And now, &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;it shall be&lt;/i&gt; blessed for ever.</verse>
