      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; his God, as the heart of David his father.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Nevertheless for David's sake did the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Because David did &lt;i&gt;that which was&lt;/i&gt; right in the eyes of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and turned not aside from any &lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt; that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And Asa did &lt;i&gt;that which was&lt;/i&gt; right in the eyes of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, as &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; David his father.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; by the brook Kidron.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; all his days.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, silver, and gold, and vessels.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16" newPara="true">And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Then Asa took all the silver and the gold &lt;i&gt;that were&lt;/i&gt; left in the treasures of the house of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">&lt;i&gt;There is&lt;/i&gt; a league between me and thee, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">So Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And it came to pass, when Baasha heard &lt;i&gt;thereof&lt;/i&gt;, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25" newPara="true">And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And he did evil in the sight of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27" newPara="true">And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which &lt;i&gt;belonged&lt;/i&gt; to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">And it came to pass, when he reigned, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of Israel to anger.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31" newPara="true">Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">And he did evil in the sight of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.</verse>
