      <verse number="1" id="v1">And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all &lt;i&gt;ye&lt;/i&gt; that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; the third hour of the day.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And it shall come to pass, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Men &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps;'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37" newPara="true">Now when they heard &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; brethren, what shall we do?</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; as many as the Lord our God shall call.</verse>
      <verse number="40" id="v40">And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</verse>
      <verse number="41" id="v41" newPara="true">Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added &lt;i&gt;unto them&lt;/i&gt; about three thousand souls.</verse>
      <verse number="42" id="v42">And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</verse>
      <verse number="43" id="v43">And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</verse>
      <verse number="44" id="v44">And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</verse>
      <verse number="45" id="v45">And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt;, as every man had need.</verse>
      <verse number="46" id="v46">And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</verse>
      <verse number="47" id="v47">Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</verse>
