      <verse number="1" id="v1">For the law having a shadow of good things to come, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">But in those &lt;span class='extra'&gt;sacrifices there is&lt;/span&gt; a remembrance again &lt;span class='extra'&gt;made&lt;/span&gt; of sins every year.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">For &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it is&lt;/span&gt; not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">In burnt offerings and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;sacrifices&lt;/span&gt; for sin thou hast had no pleasure.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;offering&lt;/span&gt; for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure &lt;span class='extra'&gt;therein&lt;/span&gt;; which are offered by the law;</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once &lt;span class='extra'&gt;for all&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">&lt;span class='extra'&gt;Whereof&lt;/span&gt; the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">This &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Now where remission of these &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is, there is&lt;/span&gt; no more offering for sin.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And &lt;span class='extra'&gt;having&lt;/span&gt; an high priest over the house of God;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">Let us hold fast the profession of &lt;span class='extra'&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; faith without wavering; (for he &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; faithful that promised;)</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is;&lt;/span&gt; but exhorting &lt;span class='extra'&gt;one another&lt;/span&gt;: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">For we know him that hath said, Vengeance &lt;span class='extra'&gt;belongeth&lt;/span&gt; unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</verse>
      <verse number="31" id="v31">&lt;span class='extra'&gt;It is&lt;/span&gt; a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
      <verse number="32" id="v32">But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;</verse>
      <verse number="33" id="v33">Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.</verse>
      <verse number="34" id="v34">For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</verse>
      <verse number="35" id="v35">Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</verse>
      <verse number="36" id="v36">For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</verse>
      <verse number="37" id="v37">For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</verse>
      <verse number="38" id="v38">Now the just shall live by faith: but if &lt;span class='extra'&gt;any man&lt;/span&gt; draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</verse>
      <verse number="39" id="v39">But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</verse>
