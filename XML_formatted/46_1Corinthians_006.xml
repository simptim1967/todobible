      <verse number="1" id="v1">Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather &lt;i&gt;suffer yourselves to&lt;/i&gt; be defrauded?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; brethren.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; the members of an harlot? God forbid.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost &lt;i&gt;which is&lt;/i&gt; in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</verse>
