      <verse number="3" id="v3">And it shall come to pass, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And it shall come to pass in that day, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">But he shall say, I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; no prophet, I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.</verse>
