      <verse number="1" id="v1">And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; mountains of brass.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">In the first chariot &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; these, my lord?</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the angel answered and said unto me, These &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">The black horses which &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">And the word of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; came unto me, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Take of &lt;i&gt;them of&lt;/i&gt; the captivity, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;:</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Even he shall build the temple of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And they &lt;i&gt;that are&lt;/i&gt; far off shall come and build in the temple of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and ye shall know that the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts hath sent me unto you. And &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; your God.</verse>
