      <verse number="12" id="v12">For &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it was&lt;/span&gt; not an enemy &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; reproached me; then I could have borne &lt;span class='extra'&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;: neither &lt;span class='extra'&gt;was it&lt;/span&gt; he that hated me &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; did magnify &lt;span class='extra'&gt;himself&lt;/span&gt; against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</verse>

      <verse number="19" id="v19">God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</verse>
