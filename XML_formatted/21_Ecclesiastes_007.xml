      <verse number="1" id="v1">A good name &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2" newPara="true">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;It is&lt;/span&gt; better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the end of all men; and the living will lay &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; to his heart.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Sorrow &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">The heart of the wise &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in the house of mirth.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;It is&lt;/span&gt; better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the laughter of the fool: this also &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; vanity.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Better &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; the patient in spirit &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; better than the proud in spirit.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Say not thou, What is &lt;span class="extra"&gt;the cause&lt;/span&gt; that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11" newPara="true">Wisdom &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; good with an inheritance: and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;by it there is&lt;/span&gt; profit to them that see the sun.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">For wisdom &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a defence, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; money &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a defence: but the excellency of knowledge &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is, that&lt;/span&gt; wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Consider the work of God: for who can make &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; straight, which he hath made crooked?</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">All &lt;span class="extra"&gt;things&lt;/span&gt; have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just &lt;span class="extra"&gt;man&lt;/span&gt; that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked &lt;span class="extra"&gt;man&lt;/span&gt; that prolongeth &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his life&lt;/span&gt; in his wickedness.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;span class="extra"&gt;It is&lt;/span&gt; good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty &lt;span class="extra"&gt;men&lt;/span&gt; which are in the city.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">For &lt;span class="extra"&gt;there is&lt;/span&gt; not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23" newPara="true">All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; far from me.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of things&lt;/span&gt;, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; madness:</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; snares and nets, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; her hands &lt;span class="extra"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;counting&lt;/span&gt; one by one, to find out the account:</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28">Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</verse>
