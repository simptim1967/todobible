      <verse number="2" id="v2">Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6" newPara="true">And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And those men said unto him, We &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; in his appointed season among the children of Israel?</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will command concerning you.</verse>

      <verse number="11" id="v11">The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; eat it with unleavened bread and bitter &lt;span class="extra"&gt;herbs&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">But the man that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15" newPara="true">And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;namely&lt;/span&gt;, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">So it was alway: the cloud covered it &lt;span class="extra"&gt;by day&lt;/span&gt;, and the appearance of fire by night.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">At the commandment of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and journeyed not.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And &lt;span class="extra"&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; they journeyed.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And &lt;span class="extra"&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it was&lt;/span&gt; by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Or &lt;span class="extra"&gt;whether it were&lt;/span&gt; two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">At the commandment of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; they journeyed: they kept the charge of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, at the commandment of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; by the hand of Moses.</verse>
