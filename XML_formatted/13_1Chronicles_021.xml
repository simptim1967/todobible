      <verse number="1" id="v1">And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And Joab answered, The &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; make his people an hundred times so many more as they &lt;span class="extra"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;: but, my lord the king, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5" newPara="true">And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all &lt;span class="extra"&gt;they of&lt;/span&gt; Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah &lt;span class="extra"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, I offer thee three &lt;span class="extra"&gt;things&lt;/span&gt;: choose thee one of them, that I may do &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; unto thee.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, Choose thee</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thee&lt;/span&gt;; or else three days the sword of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; for very great &lt;span class="extra"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14" newPara="true">So the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders &lt;span class="extra"&gt;of Israel, who were&lt;/span&gt; clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And David said unto God, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;Is it&lt;/span&gt; not I &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but &lt;span class="extra"&gt;as for&lt;/span&gt; these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18" newPara="true">Then the angel of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with &lt;span class="extra"&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; face to the ground.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of &lt;span class="extra"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">And Ornan said unto David, Take &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; to thee, and let my lord the king do &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that which is&lt;/span&gt; good in his eyes: lo, I give &lt;span class="extra"&gt;thee&lt;/span&gt; the oxen &lt;span class="extra"&gt;also&lt;/span&gt; for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take &lt;span class="extra"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; thine for the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">And David built there an altar unto the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</verse>
      <verse number="27" id="v27">And the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</verse>
      <verse number="28" id="v28" newPara="true">At that time when David saw that the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</verse>
      <verse number="29" id="v29">For the tabernacle of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</verse>
      <verse number="30" id="v30">But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
