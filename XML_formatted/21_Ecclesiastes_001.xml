      <verse number="10" id="v10">Is there &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; thing whereof it may be said, See, this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">&lt;i&gt;There is&lt;/i&gt; no remembrance of former &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt;; neither shall there be &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; remembrance of &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; that are to come with &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; that shall come after.</verse>

      <verse number="13" id="v13">And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">&lt;i&gt;That which is&lt;/i&gt; crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</verse>
