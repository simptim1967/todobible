      <verse number="1" id="v1">And it came to pass, when the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said &lt;span class="extra"&gt;unto him, As&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; liveth, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">And the sons of the prophets that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;; hold ye your peace.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; liveth, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">And the sons of the prophets that &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;; hold ye your peace.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;As&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; liveth, and &lt;span class="extra"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9" newPara="true">And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: &lt;span class="extra"&gt;nevertheless&lt;/span&gt;, if thou see me &lt;span class="extra"&gt;when I am&lt;/span&gt; taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be &lt;span class="extra"&gt;so&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, &lt;span class="extra"&gt;there appeared&lt;/span&gt; a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12" newPara="true">And Elisha saw &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">And when the sons of the prophets which &lt;span class="extra"&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16" newPara="true">And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19" newPara="true">And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water &lt;span class="extra"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; naught, and the ground barren.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought &lt;span class="extra"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; to him.</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren &lt;span class="extra"&gt;land&lt;/span&gt;.</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23" newPara="true">And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the &lt;span class="nog"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</verse>
