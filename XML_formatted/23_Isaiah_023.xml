      <verse number="9" id="v9">The &lt;span style='font-variant: small-caps'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: &lt;i&gt;there is&lt;/i&gt; no more strength.</verse>

      <verse number="12" id="v12">And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, &lt;i&gt;till&lt;/i&gt; the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; he brought it to ruin.</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.</verse>
