      <verse number="1" id="v1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">And Job spake, and said,</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night &lt;i&gt;in which&lt;/i&gt; it was said, There is a man child conceived.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5">Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">&lt;i&gt;As&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Because it shut not up the doors of my &lt;i&gt;mother's&lt;/i&gt; womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">Why died I not from the womb? &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; did I &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</verse>
      <verse number="12" id="v12">Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</verse>
      <verse number="13" id="v13">For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</verse>
      <verse number="14" id="v14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</verse>
      <verse number="15" id="v15">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
      <verse number="16" id="v16">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; never saw light.</verse>
      <verse number="17" id="v17">There the wicked cease &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</verse>
      <verse number="18" id="v18">&lt;i&gt;There&lt;/i&gt; the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</verse>
      <verse number="19" id="v19">The small and great are there; and the servant &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; free from his master.</verse>
      <verse number="20" id="v20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; soul;</verse>
      <verse number="21" id="v21">Which long for death, but it &lt;i&gt;cometh&lt;/i&gt; not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
      <verse number="22" id="v22">Which rejoice exceedingly, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
      <verse number="23" id="v23">&lt;i&gt;Why is light given&lt;/i&gt; to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
      <verse number="24" id="v24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</verse>
      <verse number="25" id="v25">For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</verse>
      <verse number="26" id="v26">I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</verse>
