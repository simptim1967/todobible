      <verse number="1" id="v1">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and &lt;span class='extra'&gt;put it&lt;/span&gt; also in writing, saying,</verse>
      <verse number="2" id="v2">Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in Judah.</verse>
      <verse number="3" id="v3">Who &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is there&lt;/span&gt; among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in Judah, and build the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; God of Israel, (he &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the God,) which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse number="4" id="v4">And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse number="5" id="v5" newPara="true">Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them&lt;/span&gt; whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; which &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; in Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse number="6" id="v6">And all they that &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all &lt;span class='extra'&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; was willingly offered.</verse>
      <verse number="7" id="v7" newPara="true">Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the &lt;span class='nog'&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;</verse>
      <verse number="8" id="v8">Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</verse>
      <verse number="9" id="v9">And this &lt;span class='extra'&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,</verse>
      <verse number="10" id="v10">Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second &lt;span class='extra'&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt; four hundred and ten, &lt;span class='extra'&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; other vessels a thousand.</verse>
      <verse number="11" id="v11">All the vessels of gold and of silver &lt;span class='extra'&gt;were&lt;/span&gt; five thousand and four hundred. All &lt;span class='extra'&gt;these&lt;/span&gt; did Sheshbazzar bring up with &lt;span class='extra'&gt;them of&lt;/span&gt; the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.</verse>
